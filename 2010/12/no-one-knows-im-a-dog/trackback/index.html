				<div class="entry-content">
<p>My mom had a subscription to <em>The New Yorker</em> when I was a kid. I borrowed them because I liked the cartoons. At least, I liked the ones I understood. Roz Chast was my favorite because her cartoons were the most frequently gettable. A lot of the others were over my ten-year-old head.</p>
<p>I later grew up, got my own subscription, and figured out that <em>New Yorker </em>cartoons are usually over most adults&#8217; heads, too.</p>
<p>In the back of my mind, I always wanted to be a<em> New Yorker</em> cartoonist. It was one of those idle wants, rather than a realistic goal; otherwise, I&#8217;d be better by now. Generally, when people say, &#8220;I wish I could do that,&#8221; they mean &#8220;without having to put in the required work.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I have what they&#8217;re looking for, anyway, content-wise. I tend to make jokes about old memes&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/new-yorker-cheezburger.png"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/new-yorker-cheezburger1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-220" title="new-yorker-cheezburger" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/new-yorker-cheezburger1.png" alt="" width="500" height="371" /></a><br />
</a>And I have a feeling there&#8217;s not much overlap between the readership of <em>The New Yorker</em> and that of <em>Nintendo Power</em>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorker-squirtle.png"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorker-squirtle1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-219" title="newyorker-squirtle" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorker-squirtle1.png" alt="" width="499" height="343" /></a></a>I drew a different version of the Squirtle cartoon a couple years ago, but wasn&#8217;t completely satisfied with it. In that one, they were on a life raft, but I&#8217;ve since learned that the desert island setting is apparently a <em>New Yorker</em> clich√©, so a change of venue was obviously in order.</p>
<p>What are you supposed to cartoon about? Probably lawyers or something. The stock market. Adult relationships. Dinner parties. Self-aware but affectionate jokes about the absurdities of life in Manhattan: something about cabs or traffic, $900 shoes.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorker-shoes-2.png"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorker-shoes-21.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-218" title="newyorker-shoes-2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorker-shoes-21.png" alt="" width="508" height="340" /></a><br />
</a>I think Marisa Marchetto might have already done that one.</p>
<p>There are a lot of dogs in <em>New Yorker</em> cartoons, too, as I recall. I was going to draw a dog at a big executive desk saying something like &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m a dog.&#8221; But then I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I also read the tiny black and white ads in the margins, near the back. Everyone can understand ads! They were always for things that were expensive and unnecessary and hard to find &#8211; not enough to make them seem particularly luxurious, but just enough to seem silly. Since this was a couple decades ago, you couldn&#8217;t order anything online. You looked at the tiny ad and, I guess, called the number with credit card in hand or mailed a check to the address. I always wondered who did that, and if people at the library stopped them and said, &#8220;Oh! Is that the whale pin that was in <em>The New Yorker</em>? It&#8217;s very sophisticated. Yes, I read it too! Let&#8217;s be sophisticated friends.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorkerad-whale1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-223" title="newyorkerad-whale" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorkerad-whale1.png" alt="" width="350" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorkerad-whale.png"></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/tie-ad.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-222" title="tie-ad" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/tie-ad.png" alt="" width="350" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>You know what else was also interesting? The Absolut ads on the back cover. I&#8217;d congratulate them on snagging a customer before she knew what vodka was, but I think the last time I bought vodka was five years ago, and it was Grey Goose.</p>
<p><em>Commentary:</em> I keep drawing with the tablet because it&#8217;s less messy, erasing is easier, and I can skip scanning altogether. The line quality is much worse, though, so I&#8217;m trading quality for convenience. There&#8217;s surely a way to draw with a tablet without it looking crappy, so I&#8217;ve got to figure that out. Also, I really enjoy doing fake ads.</p>
