				<div class="entry-content">
<p>I mentioned in a previous entry that I am reading Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, and giving all of the exercises an honest effort. At the time of this posting, I’m about halfway through. I won’t blog a complete blow-by-blow, but I’ll post some highlights and my thoughts.</p>
<p>The first thing you’re supposed to do is a few “before” drawings in pencil. One of them is a self-portrait.</p>
<p>At this point, I’m tempted to skip through to the end and see if all we’re doing is drawing pencil portraits, because I’m really not a pencil-portrait kind of person. I think I got rid of all my drawing pencils years ago, even.</p>
<p>It took me a while to dig up a pencil of any variety, and was thrilled to find a 4B. I’m already ahead of you, book! Finding a pencil sharpener took another five minutes, and even then all I could rustle up was one intended for eyeliner pencils. Eyeliner pencils aren’t intended to be sharpened to a fine point. That’s okay. I don’t need a fine point. I’m an artist.</p>
<p>So here goes.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/selfportrait.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105" title="selfportrait" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/selfportrait.jpg" alt="" width="181" height="398" /></a></p>
<p>I’m hesitant to put my face online, so I’m only showing part of the drawing. Enough so you can tell I’m not a horrible artist, but not enough so you can identify me. Which may be beside the point, because my boyfriend says it doesn’t really look like me anyway. My eyes are crooked in this drawing, and I knew it, but I didn’t have an eraser.</p>
<p>Next you are supposed to draw a person from memory. I drew Gordon Ramsay, because we’ve been watching a lot of Kitchen Nightmares and I figure I’d remember him okay.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/gordonramsay.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106" title="gordonramsay" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/gordonramsay.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="633" /></a></p>
<p>In the British edition of Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon changes shirts in front of the camera at least twice per episode, and he doesn’t wear undershirts. In the American edition, people are too busy fighting to learn how to cook, let alone change clothes. Like, Gordon Ramsay should do an evalutation of the American edition of his own damn show and tell the producers that it’s rubbish and then instruct them how to clean up the dramatic music, fire the narrator, and focus on a rustic production with real cooking, or something.</p>
<p>The final “before” drawing is of your hand. Presumably because the face ain’t listening.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/hand.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107" title="hand" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/hand.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="523" /></a><br />
One day I will evolve opposable thumbs.</p>
<p>Other than the short thumb, this isn’t really the worst drawing ever. I could have gone back over it with an eraser, if I’d had one, and made the shading all smooth and pretty. Instead I was like “yeah, that’s a reasonable sketch of a hand.”</p>
<p>I timed myself on the last two drawings. I didn’t think of it for the first one. You’re supposed to set aside half an hour for each drawing, and going slower might have helped me, but I’d like to be able to draw my hand faster than I can run a mile. If I’m going to be drawing a lot, I’d like to be efficient.</p>
<p>So far I’m still on the fence on the book’s usefulness. I don’t think I’m its target audience; what I want to learn and what this book tries to teach don’t overlap completely. I think it’s a good refresher for me, as far as observation and concentration are concerned, but I haven’t yet discovered anything that has revolutionized my ways of perceiving. I’ve drawn from life before, not with perfect accuracy but reasonably well, and I’m familiar with viewing objects as a collection of shapes and lines and planes instead of trying to make them fit preconceptions.</p>
<p>However, at this point I’m still a little resistant to the book’s message: it focuses on realism in drawing, and I enjoy drawing with a more cartoony feel (what’s the correct term here? Partial abstraction? I should know this!), and I want the two to inform each other. The author keeps telling us that we need to abandon our symbolic vocabulary. If the symbols don’t work, then yes, throw ‘em out. But unless you draw only from life, you will need symbols. Symbols that are developed through observation, but symbols all the same. I want to be able to draw the same nose from any angle with one or two lines, and you can’t do that without having a comprehensive mental library of working symbols.</p>
<p>I’m guessing this will all come together later, or in a different book with a different focus.</p>
