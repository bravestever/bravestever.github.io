<p>Ice Cream Lady looks horrible in panel #2, no? Oh well, I guess that part looks bad. Distractingly, hilariously bad. Kindergarten bad. This is why people draw comics in pencil first. Also why people spend more than five minutes working on things and why, when you make a mistake, you don&#8217;t just go &#8220;OH WELL I GUESS THAT PART LOOKS BAD.&#8221; Oh well. Wait, I already said that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I saw a commercial for some national-brand beer, probably Miller Lite. The sound was off, but you could tell it was exactly the same as every other horrible beer commercial: some dude has a generic hot girlfriend who likes being all romantical and whatever, and then the dude declares his love for the advertised beer, and this really irritates the girlfriend.</p>
<p>Quicko sketcho of how I wish these commercials played out:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time for another muggy six hours of marching band practice. You guys brought your sunscreen and thermoses of Mountain Dew, right?</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-marktiming.jpg"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-marktiming1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-97" title="mandy-marktiming" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-marktiming1.jpg" alt="" width="346" height="260" /></a></a></p>
<p>The present participle of &#8220;mark time&#8221; is &#8220;mark timing,&#8221; according to everyone else in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">march banding</span> marching band. That drove me crazy. And of course they&#8217;re not doing it right because they&#8217;re trying to march in 7.391/4 time and no one bothered to give anyone in the colorguard a copy of the score.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-fat.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-98" title="mandy-fat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-fat.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="476" /></a></p>
<p>I was the fattest flag girl. Or I thought I was, even though I was nearly identical in size to one of our captains. From the bleachers you couldn&#8217;t tell any of us apart anyway. No one&#8217;s even looking at you, they&#8217;re looking at the helicopter toss you just dropped.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like the way I drew the two foreground girls in panel two. They shouldn&#8217;t be the same height and they shouldn&#8217;t be exactly side by side &#8211; it looks flat and amateurish. I tried to tilt the shoulders a little bit, but I don&#8217;t think it worked out. I need to work on drawing people from the back in general. Teenage Girl turned out pretty good though.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-hottestguy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95" title="mandy-hottestguy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-hottestguy.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="177" /></a></p>
<p>Band is its own little social hierarchy within the larger high school hierarchy. I like how Mandy&#8217;s shirt looks like it says &#8220;frogs.&#8221; Let&#8217;s go OHS Frogs!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-gettinpaid.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-99" title="mandy-gettinpaid" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-gettinpaid.jpg" alt="" width="406" height="251" /></a>Ba-duh-duh-dum, ba-duh-duh DOMP DOMP.</p>

<p>I decided to do a few quick doodles about a former flag girl returning to her alma mater to pass on her wisdom and bitterness.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-revenge.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90" title="mandy-revenge" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-revenge.jpg" alt="" width="487" height="205" /></a></p>
<p>I would actually really like to return to flag twirling. I would also actually really like to yell at my high school band director.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-thisyear.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91" title="mandy-thisyear" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-thisyear.jpg" alt="" width="272" height="442" /></a></p>
<p>If you must doodle, doodle somewhere else.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-intro.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92" title="mandy-intro" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-intro.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>One of the things I want (and <em>really need</em>) to work on is the ability to draw characters in action and from multiple angles.</p>
<p>More tomorrow!</p>

<p>Moving to Boston has made me want two kinds of pants: lobster-print pajama pants, and Harvard sweatpants. I wanted to find pants with HARVARD on the butt, but they&#8217;re too classy of a school to make them.</p>
