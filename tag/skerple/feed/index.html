				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s like two feet of snow here, and it&#8217;s probably going to be hanging around and growing increasingly grungy until mid-March. I hate winter. So I decided to draw a beach scene.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-smokingcrabs.png"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-smokingcrabs1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-237" title="skerple-smokingcrabs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-smokingcrabs1.png" alt="" width="436" height="440" /></a></a></p>
<p>Except&#8230; Crabs, what are you doing?! <a href="http://soundcloud.com/isilence/crab-why-do-you-smoke">Why do you smoke</a>? You&#8217;re crabs! And you&#8217;re polluting the air and the beach!</p>
<p>I doodled a drug-awareness scene from the eighties, too. Growing up in the eighties meant being constantly vigilant of cool kids who would stop at nothing to get you to take drugs.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-wantsomedrugs.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-238" title="skerple-wantsomedrugs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-wantsomedrugs.png" alt="" width="450" height="466" /></a></p>
<p>And then they&#8217;d show you all their drugs, which would be, like, a beer, a cigarette, assorted pills, and some weird stuff that they don&#8217;t explain and you wouldn&#8217;t know what to do with.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-justonedrug.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-239" title="skerple-justonedrug" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-justonedrug.png" alt="" width="450" height="311" /></a>I get the sense I&#8217;ve doodled about the hilarious 80s drug videos before, but I don&#8217;t think I have. I think it&#8217;s just something I like making fun of, but hadn&#8217;t skerped to paper yet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the Clash of the Titans remake earlier this year, the kraken has gotten a lot of attention. It&#8217;s always <em>The Kraken</em>, like there&#8217;s only one. I suspect &#8220;kraken&#8221; is a title, and each ocean holds an election every four years in which all mature cephalopods may vote. The bottom of the sea is littered with<em> Glurp for Kraken &#8217;72</em> signs. Octopuses in general seem to be trendy this year, same as owls, and I&#8217;m a little disappointed because critters shouldn&#8217;t be trendy. I am going to be totally into praying mantises in 2011 before the hipsters catch on. You heard it here first.</p>
<p>But for now, I still like making kraken jokes.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-krakencheese1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-227" title="skerple-krakencheese" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-krakencheese1.png" alt="" width="400" height="540" /></a><br />
Seafood and cheese kind of really don&#8217;t go together. I hope you weren&#8217;t eating breakfast.</p>
<p>But if you were, here&#8217;s a months-old kraken drawing from my sketchbook for you:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-krakenoatbran.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-228" title="skerple-krakenoatbran" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-krakenoatbran.png" alt="" width="300" height="385" /></a>RELEASE THE FIBER!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chickens!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-chickens.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-205" title="skerple-chickens" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-chickens.png" alt="" width="494" height="229" /></a></p>
<p>A chickeny duck and some ducky ducks:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-ducks.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-206" title="skerple-ducks" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-ducks.png" alt="" width="415" height="178" /></a></p>
<p>A penguin who looks like a thermos and a parrot who looks like I don&#8217;t know how to draw parrots:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-penguin.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-207" title="skerple-penguin" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-penguin.png" alt="" width="199" height="195" /></a></p>
<p>When I try to draw parrots, they turn out like doofy birds of prey.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-parrothead.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208" title="skerple-parrothead" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-parrothead.png" alt="" width="224" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>An eagle who is obviously posing (I like his head but his body is flat and awkward), and an owl who is peeved to be sharing a branch with him:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-eagleowl.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-209" title="skerple-eagleowl" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-eagleowl.png" alt="" width="379" height="277" /></a></p>
<p>Since I can&#8217;t sit at a computer without Bonus Cat interrupting and demanding attention, here&#8217;s a Bonus Owl.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-bonusowl.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-210" title="skerple-bonusowl" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-bonusowl.png" alt="" width="130" height="195" /></a></p>
<p>Blat is thrilled to be in this post! Spock considers his presence highly illogical.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-blatspock.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211" title="skerple-blatspock" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-blatspock.png" alt="" width="391" height="260" /></a></p>
<p>Conclusion: I like drawing birds.</p>

<p>I let my Sketchbook Project sketchbook sit untouched for about a month because I was really intimidated by having it look perfect. That&#8217;s kind of crazy, because it&#8217;s a sketchbook. So I&#8217;m just penciling stuff in and after that&#8217;s done I&#8217;ll go back and make it look like something, perhaps. I&#8217;ve realized that if I&#8217;m ever going to draw any sort of scene, I&#8217;m going to have to learn to draw scenery. I&#8217;ve always hated drawing backgrounds. Maybe I can make a living off drawing floating disembodied faces, because I&#8217;m not so bad at those.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some days you wake up thinking about saxophones for whatever reason. And then you decide it&#8217;d be a good exercise to try and draw a few, with a couple clarinets thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-maphone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173" title="skerple-maphone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-maphone.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="672" /></a></p>
<p>I have never played the saxophone, so attempting to draw one from memory is a fool&#8217;s errand. I did, however, play oboe! Now that&#8217;s a fine instrument. The higher-end models come with many features and options, most of which are different ways to play F.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-boe.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174" title="skerple-boe" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-boe.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>(Augh I am going to have to start remembering to look for that line that appears on the bottom of all my scans and start cropping it off. That&#8217;s not the edge of the paper; I don&#8217;t know what it is.)</p>
<p>I suspect F. Lorée or whoever invented the oboe didn&#8217;t think the ergonomics through, and then they had to add more alternate F keys as an afterthought.</p>
<p>Anyway I might have to borrow some woodwind instruments for sketching purposes. They&#8217;ve got tons of interesting detail.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve figured out why Skerple Friday is getting progressively harder each week. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m getting burnt out on drawing (though my Skerples certainly are), and it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m still tired from the workweek. It&#8217;s that mornings are so <em>dark</em> now. It&#8217;s tough to haul myself out of bed, and when I do, I&#8217;m all like <em>dwuhhh</em>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-dwuh.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-160" title="skerple-dwuh" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-dwuh.png" alt="" width="550" height="671" /></a></p>
<p>Oh, and it&#8217;s raining, again. I don&#8217;t have anything clever to say about how damn much it&#8217;s rained in the past month or two. So here&#8217;s an owl.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-owl.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161" title="skerple-owl" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-owl.png" alt="" width="550" height="623" /></a></p>
<p>Although Skerple Friday is great for getting me to do something, it&#8217;s not a very serious exercise, and I need to get back into the swing of doing some hard work. Like a Very Special Mall Cat.</p>
<p>Oh! Don&#8217;t let me forget to sign up for the <a href="http://arthousecoop.com/projects/sketchbookproject">Sketchbook Project</a>!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s happening. My Skerples are drying out. They&#8217;re turning into Skerple corpses. (&#8230;skrerpses.) I may have to turn this into Sharpie Friday. I&#8217;m keeping the skerpses, though, and turning them into Christmas tree ornaments or something.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t know what all this is. I just woke up and started making lines.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-footballzombie.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146" title="skerple-footballzombie" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-footballzombie.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="853" /></a></p>
<p>I drew something I really didn&#8217;t like over on the right, and scratched-then-shopped it out. Then Bonus Cat showed up wondering when food was going to happen. The thinner black line is official Sharpie, aka fake Skerple.</p>
<p>And then I tried to draw the other guys from the Heathcliff cartoon. You know, the cats that weren&#8217;t Heathcliff. I&#8217;ve always wondered what sort of beef Heathcliff and Riff-Raff had such that they were never in the cartoon together. Riff-Raff was a lot better.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-riffraf1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-148" title="skerple-riffraf" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-riffraf1.jpg" alt="" width="386" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>What is it with cartoon dudes being short and cartoon ladies being twice as tall? That always bugged me in the Flintstones. (Also that Wilma and Betty had identical bodies, and their waists were smaller around than Pebbles&#8217; arm.) My best guess is that you can caricature a guy&#8217;s shortness all you want, but women have to be proportional enough to be hott. So, um, why exactly does a female cat in a kids&#8217; cartoon have to be hott?</p>
<p>Also, I forgot that Cleo&#8217;s hair goes up, not out. The 80s are weird.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-catillaccats.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-149" title="skerple-catillaccats" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-catillaccats.jpg" alt="" width="534" height="294" /></a></p>
<p>These guys were like the ambassadors who spoke to both Heathcliff and Riff-Raff. Maybe they delivered packages. Hector (the BORING one!) is also supposed to have bigger hair, and, hilariously, a skinny tie. I got Wordsworth&#8217;s headphones all wrong, but he found them in a junkyard.</p>
