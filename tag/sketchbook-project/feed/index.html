				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, my <a href="http://www.arthousecoop.com/projects/sketchbookproject">Sketchbook Project</a> sketchbook is done! Or, at least, I filled all the pages and actually mailed the thing in. I kept putting it off, and when I did work on it I didn&#8217;t put a whole ton into it. All my sketches were loose and penciled, and in many of them you can tell I&#8217;m still figuring out the blocking and proportions of everything. There&#8217;s something about the point when an activity becomes an obligation that really throws me.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mostimportant.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-253" title="vengeance-mostimportant" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mostimportant.png" alt="" width="449" height="772" /></a></p>
<p>The part I really liked was creating the narrative. In Vengeance Bus, two surly young women buy an old school bus and a megaphone and go around telling off the people who&#8217;ve wronged them. Most of the story is the two heroines sniping about things, getting irritated with each other, and being totally unable to navigate a bus through a crowded city.</p>

<p>Julie, the surlier of the two vengeancers, ended up being a lot chunkier than my <a href="/2010/11/a-season-of-vengeance/">sketch from a couple months ago</a>. I like creating heavier characters, because I&#8217;ve been heavier for most of my life, and I like having characters I can relate to. Not only that, but it&#8217;s hard to find female characters who aren&#8217;t beautiful. Either they&#8217;re eye-candy romantic interests, or they&#8217;re chicklit everygirls who are supposed to be just like you, except they&#8217;re played by someone like Anne Hathaway, and you&#8217;re supposed to either pretend that looking like Anne Hathaway is totally normal, or start thinking that maybe you too look like Anne Hathaway. If I wrote more (or any) fiction, and maybe I should, quite a few of my female protagonists would be thoroughly unremarkable-looking, and not terribly bothered by that fact.</p>
<p>Anyway, my initial vision was to have the sketchbook mostly fleshed out and resembling a graphic novel; that didn&#8217;t happen. I knew that was a lofty goal. I do think I should have put a little more care into the drawing. As of right now I&#8217;m considering Vengeance But a publicly viewable super-rough draft, and heavily considering working on a more polished version.</p>
