				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been trying to establish doodling as a daily habit. Some of the things I&#8217;ve done in the last week or so:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-babies.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261" title="040111-babies" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-babies.jpg" alt="" width="127" height="463" /></a>Babbys, and half a preschooler.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-mustachecouch.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-263" title="040111-mustachecouch" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-mustachecouch.jpg" alt="" width="361" height="162" /></a>A hipster couch.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-steampunkarmchair.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264" title="040111-steampunkarmchair" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-steampunkarmchair.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="187" /></a>I still find inappropriately steampunked objects disproportionately amusing.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-livingroom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262" title="040111-livingroom" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-livingroom.jpg" alt="" width="452" height="304" /></a>I need to practice backgrounds. I hate drawing them, but I love seeing them well-done. I threw a George Booth dog in there before I realized I have no memory of what George Booth dogs actually look like.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-predisents.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265" title="040111-predisents" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-predisents.jpg" alt="" width="381" height="204" /></a>A good exercise is to try and draw famous people from memory. These are the money guy and, um, I clearly don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-tinyart.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266" title="040111-tinyart" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-tinyart.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="238" /></a>I got <a href="http://www.muji.us/store/stationery/pen-pencil/gel-ink-ballpoint-pen-hexagonal-0-4mm.html">a lovely new pen from Muji</a> a couple months ago and it is the best pen and I love it. This scan doesn&#8217;t capture the greatness that is this pen, or the smallness that is Tiny Art Boy. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to draw little tiny things with nice pens on nice paper. Maybe I can make a career out of selling drawings the size of my thumbnail.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because &#8217;tis the season, here&#8217;s a special holiday comic:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/trickortreat.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-230" title="trickortreat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/trickortreat.png" alt="" width="211" height="772" /></a>I didn&#8217;t specify <em>which</em> holiday.</p>
<p>I drew this pretty hastily around Halloween, when our computers got stolen and I couldn&#8217;t scan it. I like it enough to share off-season.</p>
<p>The thing about comics that I&#8217;ve discovered since starting this blog is that it can be a challenge to make things visually legible. It&#8217;s like learning a new language with its own grammar and vocabulary. Other forms of art and writing can leave room for interpretation, but if you&#8217;re ambiguous in a comic you risk losing the punchline. When I drew this, I intended Ninja Turtle Girl to be yelling for her offscreen mom to help her with the scary lady, but afterwards I realized it could also (and more likely) be read as the scary lady being her mom, which I like a little better.</p>
<p>Bravest Ever will be on a short vacation; I&#8217;ll be back after Christmas. Enjoy whatever excuse to eat candy you celebrate!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I drew this retro-dorky cowboy kid when I drew yesterday&#8217;s husky boys. See, I was thinking about husky sizing being a relic of the past, like how &#8220;Western&#8221; used to be a popular movie genre, and how clowns used to be entertaining and not terrifying.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cowboykid.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170" title="cowboykid" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cowboykid.png" alt="" width="500" height="321" /></a></p>
<p>Turns out slim/regular/husky kids&#8217; sizes still exist, and I&#8217;ve been wearing grown-up sizes for years, so it&#8217;s a thing of my childhood that I&#8217;d mistaken for a thing of the past. I looked into it, and Sears still sells slim and husky. So does Gap Kids. Abercrombie Kids only sells slim and regular, because everyone knows only cool kids wear Abercrombie, and fat kids can&#8217;t be cool. Kids are freaking mean.</p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t trust kids&#8217; judgment. It&#8217;s all that TV they watch, you know.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/watchingtv.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171" title="watchingtv" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/watchingtv.png" alt="" width="500" height="447" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been drawing these in a shiny new <a href="http://whitelines.se/">Whitelines</a> notebook. I&#8217;m on the fence about it. I thought the paper would be white with printed white lines, in a slightly brighter white or a slightly glossy ink. Instead, the negative space is printed on, and it&#8217;s very slightly gray. I really like having the grid as a reference without it being distracting, but the lines don&#8217;t actually go completely away when scanned, which is disappointing. You still have to futz with the brightness and contrast levels, but it&#8217;s a little easier. If you look closely you can see the lines in the above picture, in addition to my lazy photoshopping. Trying to get the background of my scans to be perfectly white is still a challenge for me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple things from the sketchbook. Apropos of nothing, here&#8217;s me in a Slanket.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/slanket.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164" title="slanket" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/slanket.png" alt="" width="400" height="437" /></a>No, emphatically <em>not</em> a Snuggie. Are you crazy? Snuggies suck.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a chubby sad kid:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sadfatkid.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-165" title="sadfatkid" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sadfatkid.png" alt="" width="500" height="388" /></a>I default to three-quarters view when drawing people, because it&#8217;s the easiest. Less foreshortening, and profiles are just trouble. The head-on view looks a lot flatter here.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I think the 3/4 view is fairly common in cartooning. I may have absorbed that.</p>
<p>More sad kids:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/searsboys.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-166" title="searsboys" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/searsboys.png" alt="" width="500" height="347" /></a>Remember at Sears how they had kids&#8217; sizes in slim, regular, and &#8220;husky?&#8221; I felt bad for both the slim and the husky boys, but kind of especially bad for the huskies. How can anyone say &#8220;husky boy&#8221; with a straight face? Then again, I recall some of my clothes were &#8220;Pretty Plus.&#8221; That might be worse.</p>
