				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you seen the <a href="http://dumbrunningsonic.tumblr.com/">Dumb Running Sonic</a> tumblr? It&#8217;s my new favorite meme. So favorite that I decided to make my own Dumb Sonic. My first ever animated gif!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dumb-animated.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-283" title="dumb-animated" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dumb-animated.gif" alt="hurr durr fart" width="400" height="282" /></a>I used a pretty neato iPad app called <a href="http://www.kdanmobile.com/en/animation-desk/">Animation Desk</a>. It doesn&#8217;t automatically export animations to .gif format &#8211; that requires some minor tweaking in Photoshop &#8211; but it&#8217;s easy to use and super fun.</p>
<p>I see a lot of dumb animated gifs in my future, because they&#8217;re fun.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[My interpretation of Lovecraftian monsters based on what I know of Lovecraft: practically nothing.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day Jim and I were talking about the works of H.P. Lovecraft. I&#8217;ve never read any Lovecraft, but I know a couple things:</p>
<ul>
<li>he lived in Providence</li>
<li>he wrote about a guy named Cthulhu</li>
<li>who lives in R&#8217;lyeh and often fhtagns, wherever and whatever that is</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are a bunch of other dread creatures who possess earth-destroying power, but are usually dumb or fast asleep and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re not dead yet. They are all eye-meltingly hideous, and their names are pronounced in the same way you&#8217;d hock a loogie.</p>
<p>Anyway, I drew what I imagine a Lovecraft story to be like:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been trying to establish doodling as a daily habit. Some of the things I&#8217;ve done in the last week or so:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-babies.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261" title="040111-babies" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-babies.jpg" alt="" width="127" height="463" /></a>Babbys, and half a preschooler.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-mustachecouch.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-263" title="040111-mustachecouch" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-mustachecouch.jpg" alt="" width="361" height="162" /></a>A hipster couch.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-steampunkarmchair.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264" title="040111-steampunkarmchair" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-steampunkarmchair.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="187" /></a>I still find inappropriately steampunked objects disproportionately amusing.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-livingroom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262" title="040111-livingroom" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-livingroom.jpg" alt="" width="452" height="304" /></a>I need to practice backgrounds. I hate drawing them, but I love seeing them well-done. I threw a George Booth dog in there before I realized I have no memory of what George Booth dogs actually look like.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-predisents.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265" title="040111-predisents" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-predisents.jpg" alt="" width="381" height="204" /></a>A good exercise is to try and draw famous people from memory. These are the money guy and, um, I clearly don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-tinyart.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266" title="040111-tinyart" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-tinyart.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="238" /></a>I got <a href="http://www.muji.us/store/stationery/pen-pencil/gel-ink-ballpoint-pen-hexagonal-0-4mm.html">a lovely new pen from Muji</a> a couple months ago and it is the best pen and I love it. This scan doesn&#8217;t capture the greatness that is this pen, or the smallness that is Tiny Art Boy. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to draw little tiny things with nice pens on nice paper. Maybe I can make a career out of selling drawings the size of my thumbnail.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve decided to discontinue Skerple Fridays. They&#8217;ve kept me posting when I&#8217;ve had nothing else, which has been a good thing. However, trying to draw something, scan it, and write a post about it in the half hour before work has proven to be a fairly tall order, and most weeks I&#8217;m just scratching something off in thirty seconds so I can be done with it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be replacing Skerple Friday with some other sort of weekly post. Likely a weekly roundup of scans from my sketchbook. I&#8217;ll have an announcement and first post in the next few days.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;ll leave you with this recipe for bee salad:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/beesalad.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-257" title="beesalad" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/beesalad.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="207" /></a>3 cups worker bees (fresh is best, but dried will do in a pinch)<br />
1 cup broccoli florets<br />
1/4 cup diced red pepper<br />
1/4 cup diced onions<br />
1 cup mayonnaise<br />
2 teaspoons ground mustard<br />
1 teaspoon paprika</p>
<p>Combine all ingredients, stir well, and serve chilled.</p>
<p>For  Three Bee Salad, use one cup honeybees, one cup bumblebees,  and one cup garbanzo bees. If you are using soy bee substitute, reduce  mayonnaise to 3/4 cup.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, my <a href="http://www.arthousecoop.com/projects/sketchbookproject">Sketchbook Project</a> sketchbook is done! Or, at least, I filled all the pages and actually mailed the thing in. I kept putting it off, and when I did work on it I didn&#8217;t put a whole ton into it. All my sketches were loose and penciled, and in many of them you can tell I&#8217;m still figuring out the blocking and proportions of everything. There&#8217;s something about the point when an activity becomes an obligation that really throws me.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mostimportant.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-253" title="vengeance-mostimportant" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mostimportant.png" alt="" width="449" height="772" /></a></p>
<p>The part I really liked was creating the narrative. In Vengeance Bus, two surly young women buy an old school bus and a megaphone and go around telling off the people who&#8217;ve wronged them. Most of the story is the two heroines sniping about things, getting irritated with each other, and being totally unable to navigate a bus through a crowded city.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mintyandjules.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254" title="vengeance-mintyandjules" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mintyandjules.png" alt="" width="458" height="664" /></a></p>
<p>Julie, the surlier of the two vengeancers, ended up being a lot chunkier than my <a href="/2010/11/a-season-of-vengeance/">sketch from a couple months ago</a>. I like creating heavier characters, because I&#8217;ve been heavier for most of my life, and I like having characters I can relate to. Not only that, but it&#8217;s hard to find female characters who aren&#8217;t beautiful. Either they&#8217;re eye-candy romantic interests, or they&#8217;re chicklit everygirls who are supposed to be just like you, except they&#8217;re played by someone like Anne Hathaway, and you&#8217;re supposed to either pretend that looking like Anne Hathaway is totally normal, or start thinking that maybe you too look like Anne Hathaway. If I wrote more (or any) fiction, and maybe I should, quite a few of my female protagonists would be thoroughly unremarkable-looking, and not terribly bothered by that fact.</p>
<p>Anyway, my initial vision was to have the sketchbook mostly fleshed out and resembling a graphic novel; that didn&#8217;t happen. I knew that was a lofty goal. I do think I should have put a little more care into the drawing. As of right now I&#8217;m considering Vengeance But a publicly viewable super-rough draft, and heavily considering working on a more polished version.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have really been phoning my Skerple Fridays in lately. It&#8217;s hard for me to do much in the morning that isn&#8217;t sleeping or drinking coffee. And Friday&#8217;s my busiest day at work so I&#8217;m already not inclined to be up and doing things. It doesn&#8217;t look good to have pages full of quarter-assed skerplings and nothing else, but I keep going because it keeps me updating even when I have nothing else. It&#8217;s like going to the gym once a week and spending ten minutes on the Air-Dyne so you can say you work out.</p>
<p>You know how everyone on the internet gets fascinated by the same thing at the same time? Yesterday it was that big chart of cat colors. I am a nerd and knew about most of it already, but what I didn&#8217;t know is that the piebald spotting gene breaks up the areas of color while the cat is still an embryo. Like continental drift. So I&#8217;ve been teasing Bonus Cat about being too fat for his embryo.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-fatcat.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-246" title="skerple-fatcat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-fatcat.png" alt="" width="322" height="178" /></a>(There&#8217;s that line from the scanner again. I don&#8217;t feel like dealing with it right now, but I&#8217;m tired of seeing it.)</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-cathycat.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-247" title="skerple-cathycat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-cathycat.png" alt="" width="392" height="277" /></a>I wonder if the time to make fun of Cathy is over. I hope not.</p>
<p>Everyone on the internet who wasn&#8217;t interested in cat fur was talking about the supposed thirteenth astrological sign, Snake Guy. I&#8217;m surprised at how possessive people are of their signs. You&#8217;d think it&#8217;d be awesome to be represented by a guy with a snake. He&#8217;s got a snake!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-snakeguy.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-248" title="skerple-snakeguy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-snakeguy.png" alt="" width="274" height="285" /></a>It&#8217;s not like the stars intend to be in the shape of a snake guy, though. It&#8217;s how someone interpreted them long ago, and no one&#8217;s challenged it because things-to-look-at technology has advanced to the point where we no longer need to look at stars. For all I know, my sign could really be Baseball Guy.</p>

Maybe over the weekend?</p>
