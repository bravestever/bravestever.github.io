<p>I did today&#8217;s Skerple Friday on the tablet instead, and I might do that from here on out. My Skerples are mostly dead, and I don&#8217;t have to futz around with the scanner.</p>
<p>I run at the gym a couple days after work, and the TV is always on either ESPN or the news. I just like having something moving to look at besides my reflection or the guy on the Airdyne, so whatever. Sometimes I&#8217;ll make up dialogue and pretend the news anchors are making fun of each others&#8217; mothers. If someone&#8217;s covering the weather, I&#8217;ll pretend the correspondent in the anorak is cursing at the smug jerks in the studio who sent her there. It&#8217;s about as much fun as you can have at the gym; try it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always a little surprised with how obsessive the sports coverage is, though. Why do you need<em> breaking news!!</em> on ESPN?</p>

<p>I have my <a href="http://www.arthousecoop.com/projects/sketchbookproject">Sketchbook Project</a> sketchbook, and so far it is blank. I&#8217;ve got performance anxiety. The examples of past sketchbooks that I&#8217;ve seen are pretty good. Better than my finished stuff. My usual sketchbook contents aren&#8217;t so intricate, mostly scribbles and half-finished cartoon people and incomprehensible notes I took while I was on the phone with the dentist.</p>
<p>Of course, they probably put the coolest stuff on the front page anyway. That&#8217;s like thinking you have to be super-accomplished because everyone in your college&#8217;s alumni newsletter is doing fascinating stuff. I&#8217;ve never sent in my updates because they&#8217;re usually &#8220;yope, I&#8217;m still temping and I&#8217;ve almost conquered my apartment&#8217;s roach infestation!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking of doing a graphic novel-type thing for my sketchbook. This is pretty ambitious, and it&#8217;s gonna be a lot of work, and I should have already started. I have a vague story arc in my head; I need to flesh it out some.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve been working on what my protagonist will look like:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/jules-1107.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-180" title="jules-1107" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/jules-1107.png" alt="" width="187" height="384" /></a>Not exactly like this, but pretty close. I try to draw her every day so I can get used to drawing her. I&#8217;m trying to adjust my style, too. The way I currently draw people isn&#8217;t very adaptable. I have a lot of trouble drawing convincing dudes, for example, and different ages.</p>
<p>Anyway, my story is called Vengeance Bus, and it&#8217;s going to be about exactly that. I&#8217;m excited about it.</p>

<p>Sorry, y&#8217;all, no Skerple Friday today. Last night some jerk broke into our house and ran off with both our laptops and the iPad. Updates might be scarce for a while.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the end of the world for us, materially or mentally, so we&#8217;re awfully fortunate.</p>
<p>However, I had some works in progress saved on my laptop, including a comic that was so close to being done. I was looking forward to finishing it last night and sharing it here, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever get that chance. The police say the odds of my laptop being recovered are slim, and even if I do get it back, the thieves usually wipe everything so they can sell it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so mad about that.</p>
<p>I will start over when I get the chance. In the meantime (spoiler alert!), if in the near future you see the word <strong>Excalivetica</strong> anywhere not in connection with my blog, that might be the bastard who took my computer.</p>

<p>Some days you wake up thinking about saxophones for whatever reason. And then you decide it&#8217;d be a good exercise to try and draw a few, with a couple clarinets thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-maphone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173" title="skerple-maphone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-maphone.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="672" /></a></p>
<p>I have never played the saxophone, so attempting to draw one from memory is a fool&#8217;s errand. I did, however, play oboe! Now that&#8217;s a fine instrument. The higher-end models come with many features and options, most of which are different ways to play F.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-boe.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174" title="skerple-boe" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-boe.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>(Augh I am going to have to start remembering to look for that line that appears on the bottom of all my scans and start cropping it off. That&#8217;s not the edge of the paper; I don&#8217;t know what it is.)</p>
<p>I suspect F. Lorée or whoever invented the oboe didn&#8217;t think the ergonomics through, and then they had to add more alternate F keys as an afterthought.</p>
<p>Anyway I might have to borrow some woodwind instruments for sketching purposes. They&#8217;ve got tons of interesting detail.</p>

<p>I drew this retro-dorky cowboy kid when I drew yesterday&#8217;s husky boys. See, I was thinking about husky sizing being a relic of the past, like how &#8220;Western&#8221; used to be a popular movie genre, and how clowns used to be entertaining and not terrifying.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cowboykid.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170" title="cowboykid" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cowboykid.png" alt="" width="500" height="321" /></a></p>
<p>Turns out slim/regular/husky kids&#8217; sizes still exist, and I&#8217;ve been wearing grown-up sizes for years, so it&#8217;s a thing of my childhood that I&#8217;d mistaken for a thing of the past. I looked into it, and Sears still sells slim and husky. So does Gap Kids. Abercrombie Kids only sells slim and regular, because everyone knows only cool kids wear Abercrombie, and fat kids can&#8217;t be cool. Kids are freaking mean.</p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t trust kids&#8217; judgment. It&#8217;s all that TV they watch, you know.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/watchingtv.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171" title="watchingtv" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/watchingtv.png" alt="" width="500" height="447" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been drawing these in a shiny new <a href="http://whitelines.se/">Whitelines</a> notebook. I&#8217;m on the fence about it. I thought the paper would be white with printed white lines, in a slightly brighter white or a slightly glossy ink. Instead, the negative space is printed on, and it&#8217;s very slightly gray. I really like having the grid as a reference without it being distracting, but the lines don&#8217;t actually go completely away when scanned, which is disappointing. You still have to futz with the brightness and contrast levels, but it&#8217;s a little easier. If you look closely you can see the lines in the above picture, in addition to my lazy photoshopping. Trying to get the background of my scans to be perfectly white is still a challenge for me.</p>

<p>A couple things from the sketchbook. Apropos of nothing, here&#8217;s me in a Slanket.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/slanket.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164" title="slanket" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/slanket.png" alt="" width="400" height="437" /></a>No, emphatically <em>not</em> a Snuggie. Are you crazy? Snuggies suck.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a chubby sad kid:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sadfatkid.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-165" title="sadfatkid" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sadfatkid.png" alt="" width="500" height="388" /></a>I default to three-quarters view when drawing people, because it&#8217;s the easiest. Less foreshortening, and profiles are just trouble. The head-on view looks a lot flatter here.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I think the 3/4 view is fairly common in cartooning. I may have absorbed that.</p>
<p>More sad kids:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/searsboys.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-166" title="searsboys" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/searsboys.png" alt="" width="500" height="347" /></a>Remember at Sears how they had kids&#8217; sizes in slim, regular, and &#8220;husky?&#8221; I felt bad for both the slim and the husky boys, but kind of especially bad for the huskies. How can anyone say &#8220;husky boy&#8221; with a straight face? Then again, I recall some of my clothes were &#8220;Pretty Plus.&#8221; That might be worse.</p>

<p>Ice Cream Lady looks horrible in panel #2, no? Oh well, I guess that part looks bad. Distractingly, hilariously bad. Kindergarten bad. This is why people draw comics in pencil first. Also why people spend more than five minutes working on things and why, when you make a mistake, you don&#8217;t just go &#8220;OH WELL I GUESS THAT PART LOOKS BAD.&#8221; Oh well.

It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m getting burnt out on drawing (though my Skerples certainly are), and it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m still tired from the workweek. It&#8217;s that mornings are so <em>dark</em> now. It&#8217;s tough to haul myself out of bed, and when I do, I&#8217;m all like <em>dwuhhh</em>.</p>

<p>Oh, and it&#8217;s raining, again. I don&#8217;t have anything clever to say about how damn much it&#8217;s rained in the past month or two. So here&#8217;s an owl.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-owl.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161" title="skerple-owl" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/skerple-owl.png" alt="" width="550" height="623" /></a></p>
<p>Although Skerple Friday is great for getting me to do something, it&#8217;s not a very serious exercise, and I need to get back into the swing of doing some hard work. Like a Very Special Mall Cat.</p>
