<p style="text-align: left;">I started writing an entry about the appeal of creating a webcomic, and how difficult it is in practice. Then I decided it&#8217;d be more interesting to make a comic about why I haven&#8217;t made any comics. If they aren&#8217;t funny, it just proves my point further.

<p>Because it is Friday and because I love you, here is something I did right before I left for work. (Well, technically, I did it last Friday before work and only got around to scanning it now.) It&#8217;s my interpretation of <em>Twilight</em> if the guy were a zombie instead of a vampire.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/skerple-twilight.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56" title="skerple-twilight" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/skerple-twilight.png" alt="HELLO MY NAME IS TWILIGHT AND I AM A BRAAAAAAAINS" width="452" height="594" /></a></p>
<p>Halfway through, I changed my mind about which way I wanted Twilight to look. That&#8217;s why he has lazy eye. Girl is purposely crazy-eyed because she is totally gaga spoony and not exactly thinking critically. Watch out, Girl! Your brain smells like lavender!</p>
<p>Medium: Skerple on paper.  Yes.  Skerple.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/skerplephoto.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57" title="skerplephoto" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/skerplephoto.png" alt="Yes! Skerple!!" width="568" height="136" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Would you believe I hunted these down on eBay? And that the word &#8220;Skerple&#8221; had me giggling uncontrollably for days?  And only three of them didn&#8217;t work!  Super bargain.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m thinking of doing a regular Friday morning Skerpling: draw the first thing that comes into my head, and post it.  I haven&#8217;t decided yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bonus Cat seems to think it&#8217;s a good idea:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/bonus-skerple.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58" title="bonus-skerple" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/bonus-skerple.png" alt="Chomp!" width="484" height="523" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He&#8217;s chewing the damn Skerple as I type this. The page he&#8217;s lying on has some logo ideas for his rebranding campaign.  We are rebranding the cat. He hasn&#8217;t given me any feedback on the logo I proposed; he&#8217;s not a very good client.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve felt pulled in a lot of different directions lately: I have to improve my drawing and I have to get more comfortable with Photoshop and Illustrator and I need to read everything and I have all these ideas that require me to do all of the above.  I&#8217;ve decided that, instead of trying to jump into everything at once, I&#8217;ll spend a while focusing on pen-and-paper drawing.</p>
<p>Yesterday I said I&#8217;d make an effort to draw something every day.  So far I&#8217;ve stuck to that, in a letter-of-the-law way.  I&#8217;d like to spend an hour a day drawing&#8230; but after you put in a day at work, go to the gym, get groceries, and make a quart of ranch dressing, you kinda don&#8217;t wanna.  So I&#8217;ve been wedging it in little by little, on lunch breaks and on the train.  Half an hour here, a quick study there.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t done much sketching from life since college.  Even then, I never got great at it.  I&#8217;d get fidgety and distracted after half an hour.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s one thing I really like about it: looking at stuff.  That sounds dumb, doesn&#8217;t it?  I like to create very doodly, cartoony things, and a lot of the things I&#8217;m drawn to are similarly doodly and cartoony.  If you go too far down that path, you can lose sight of the way real objects and people look.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to start working through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Drawing-Right-Side-Brain/dp/0874774195/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1280956362&#038;sr=1-1">Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</a>, because it&#8217;s frequently recommended and because we already have it in the house.  I&#8217;d dismissed it as gimmicky before, and the cover is uninspiring (if there&#8217;s anything I don&#8217;t want to draw, it&#8217;s straightforward pencil renderings of someone sitting still), but maybe I&#8217;ll learn something anyway.</p>
<p>But the <em>first</em> first thing I need to do is start making more time for it. </p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re behind on the blog bill, ma&#8217;am.  We&#8217;re here to take your Charmander.&#8221;</p>

<p>I want to get away from drawing Pokémon for a while, because it&#8217;s more challenging and valuable to draw real-world stuff.  I&#8217;m making an effort to draw at least something every day, no matter how small.</p>

<p>Imaginary products make me giggle.  I&#8217;ve got a few fake ads for fake products kicking around in my mind, and I’ll be working on putting them to paper.</p>
<p>I’ve got a few snapshots of some lunch-break doodles:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cerealkids.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-47" title="Can't get enough of insert-cereal-here!" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cerealkids-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Here are some kids who love an imaginary breakfast cereal.  Animated cereal commercials always have exactly two kids, a boy and a girl, who rollerblade for the munchy chomp of their preferred cereal.  As I recall, all cereal kids in a given decade look alike.  There could be only one Boy Kid/Girl Kid team out there, and they spend hours every Saturday morning simultaneously chasing after Lucky Charms and keeping their box of Trix away from the rabbit.  They&#8217;re greedy, but they&#8217;re keeping fit.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;ve got to look fit, rather than bloated from simple carbs and refined sugars, but you&#8217;ve still got to give them that rounded kid look.  Kids have almost cylindrical-looking torsos.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cerealkids2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-48" title="Jellybeans!" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cerealkids2-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m having trouble getting the look right from memory, though the top center head is close.  Adding irises to the eyes makes a big difference.   I’m going to have to do some research into cereal-kid art styles.  I’ve been putting that off, because it’ll almost certainly entail watching cereal ads until my eyes fall out.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Wigglytuff-grin.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-42" title="Wigglytuff-grin" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Wigglytuff-grin-300x262.png" alt="FRIEEEEENDS" width="300" height="262" /></a>Like my previous drawings, these were done in Adobe Ideas.  I still love Ideas, but the inability to save or retrieve colors is frustrating.  Even an eyedropper tool would be an improvement.  To get around this, I worked on all three of these drawings simultaneously, in the same document.  I&#8217;d do the bodies for all three, then the shadows for all three, and so on.  From time to time I&#8217;d see something that I needed to fix, but didn&#8217;t have the color in my palette, so it was a matter of eyeballing it, trying out a little mark, hitting undo, nudging the color selector over a tiny bit, repeating as necessary.  If you look closely you can see a few spots that don&#8217;t quite match.</p>
<p>Every medium has advantages and limitations, and you work around them.  This is as true with applications as it is with drawing in charcoal, pencil, or ink.</p>
<p>I could probably send these over to Illustrator and tidy up all the vectors so everything is a little smoother and matchier.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Wigglytuff-ugggh.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-43" title="Wigglytuff ugggh" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Wigglytuff-ugggh-300x230.png" alt="What have I done?" width="300" height="230" /></a>I know I need to work on both my technical skills and my skills of&#8230; you know, drawing.  Observational?  I forget what you call it.  In these, I could have done more with shadows.  The top picture isn&#8217;t missing much, but the middle and especially the bottom should have shadows.  Getting shadows right was a challenge for me in school, and it&#8217;s a challenge now.  When I work with lighter colors, I often hesitate to throw darker colors in the mix, because I don&#8217;t think they look right.  I&#8217;ll need to practice drawing from life to get a better idea of how to render shadows.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking of keeping track of the time I spend working on things.  The idea didn&#8217;t occur to me until I was about 80% done with these.  I timed the teeth; they took about two hours.  They were probably the most fun part, too.</p>

<p>I went to the eye doctor a couple weeks ago.  I hate the eye doctor.  I am extremely squeamish about having anything near or in my eyes.  It is going to be a very, very long time before I can be the Bravest Ever about eye exams.</p>

<p>Yet more Pokémon doodles!  You know, sometimes I wonder why people with a ton of talent use it on things like Pokémon fan art or replicating Lady Gaga videos, rather than original creations.  But I figure they&#8217;re probably creating original stuff too, and besides, I guess I&#8217;m one of those people.</p>
<p>First we have the Bellsprout family.  For some reason I associate them with telephones.  Ma Bell?  Bellsprout looks like a candlestick phone to me.  The first two doodles here aren’t any good, but I like Victreebel.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/the-bels.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15" title="the-bels" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/the-bels.jpg" alt="OFF THE LINE, CHARMANDER!" width="362" height="305" /></a></p>
<p>I’ll preface the next one by saying: I’m not into steampunk.  I kind of like the idea of old-timey intepretations of modern objects, but there’s a lot of junk out there that someone spraypainted bronze and glued a bunch of gears to.  And steampunk is the kind of thing that people are <em>into</em>.  The serious, all-out connotation of into.  If you go to the store wearing a bracelet with gears on it, people assume you’ve got a drawerful of goggles and a BlackBerry retrofitted with tiny clacky typewriter keys.  People either love steampunk or hate it, and since I don’t love it, I’m supposed to hate it.  But I don’t, so here’s steampunk Porygon, complete with hilariously nonfunctional gears:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/steampunkporygon.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14" title="steampunkporygon" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/steampunkporygon.jpg" alt="OMG look at all those GEARS" width="223" height="402" /></a></p>
<p>The below isn’t a very clear picture, either in the drawing or the scanning.  But the gist of it is: in this day and age, who writes checks at the grocery store?  Slowpoke, that’s who.<br />
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/slowpoke-check.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13" title="slowpoke-check" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/slowpoke-check.jpg" alt="Next time, use your check card. It's everywhere you want to be." width="300" height="278" /></a></p>
<p>If you look closely you can see Bulbasaur getting impatient.  I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s on the right of Charmeleon&#8217;s head.  I think it&#8217;s part of some other doodle that I started and thought better of.</p>
<p>Slowbro’s leading leg gave me a lot of trouble.  The bottom attempt is not much better.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/slowbro-jog.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12" title="slowbro-jog" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/slowbro-jog.jpg" alt="I believe in you, Slowbro!" width="262" height="339" /></a></p>
<p>And finally Koffing, the only doodle of the bunch in color.  He&#8217;s farting in a tub.  I’m not sure there’s anything I can add that could make this less juvenile.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/koffingfarting.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9" title="koffingfarting" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/koffingfarting.jpg" alt="ppppppblblblblbl" width="374" height="242" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now.  Even if I don&#8217;t do the Pokémonathon, I&#8217;ll probably have some higher-quality Pokémon drawings at some point in the future.  And I&#8217;ll get better at scanning.</p>

<p>Here is the first of potentially many slightly embarrassing revelations: I really like Pokémon.  And not because of nostalgia or camp value.  Well, partly because of camp value.  The games are well-designed and fun; there’s a lot to do, and they’re easy without being dull or tedious.</p>
<p>And there are all these weird, interesting critters.  Not that they’re all brilliant, but I would love to be a fly on the wall at a Pokémon design team meeting.  I imagine a scenario where they’re all locked in a room late at, and the boss won’t let them out until they’ve got 30 new Pokémon, and he’s certainly not springing for pizza.</p>
<p>Anyway, they’re fun to draw.  I’ve really wanted to enter the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/pokemonathon">Pokémonathon</a> for over a year now.  Two things got in my way: first, it would mean drawing a lot of Pokémon I didn’t particularly like, and second, some of those artists in the Pokémonathon are good.  I figured I couldn’t measure up.</p>
<p>But I thought about it anyway, and I doodled.  I doodled a lot.  Here are some of the doodles I like, from maybe a year ago:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/pokedoodles-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10" title="pokedoodles-1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/pokedoodles-1.jpg" alt="Pokeymans!" width="488" height="299" /></a></p>
<p>Fairly simplistic.  I wonder if “drawing everyone with doofy expressions” is a legitimate style.</p>
<p>The Bulbasaur evolutionary line is my favorite.  These guys aren’t perfect, but they amuse me:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/saurdoodles.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11" title="saurdoodles" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/saurdoodles.jpg" alt="Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur" width="439" height="159" /></a></p>
<p>I also like this Charmander and Charmeleon.  If you’ve ever watched the cartoon (okay, fine, I did, but I swear that was purely for camp value), you’ll recall that Ash’s Charmander was kind of a wuss, and then he evolved into a surly Charmeleon.  I like to assume that those personalities are species-wide, which I guess makes me a char-ist.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/chardoodles.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7" title="chardoodles" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/chardoodles.jpg" alt="Char!" width="205" height="125" /></a></p>
<p>I hate Clefairy.  I like Jigglypuff.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/clefairy-jigglypuff.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8" title="clefairy-jigglypuff" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/clefairy-jigglypuff.jpg" alt="No one likes you, Clefairy. Go back to the moon." width="178" height="91" /></a></p>
<p>One day I’m going to be pitching ideas to some big important client, and they’re going to look up my name and discover that I once drew a picture of Wigglytuff on the toilet, and they will hire someone else.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/wigglytuff-toilet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16" title="wigglytuff-toilet" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/wigglytuff-toilet.jpg" alt="The existence of this drawing will probably prevent me from ever being elected for public office." width="218" height="241" /></a></p>
<p>None of these are Pokémonathon quality, but I may enter at some point &#8211; it’d be a good challenge.  At any rate, drawing Pokémon is good practice, both for technique and for trying out different styles.  I’ve got a few more, which I’ll post soon.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
<p>If you have an iPhone or iPad, check out <a href="http://www.100rogues.com/">100 Rogues</a>.  It’s a great game.  It&#8217;s also a really tough game, so it&#8217;s good for gamers who appreciate challenge and the concept of <a href="http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma8/imperm.html">impermanence</a>, and a little more frustrating if you like to stay with your character until his stats and inventory are maxed out.  I confess I&#8217;m in the latter group, so I haven&#8217;t played much of the game.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I was excited to learn that the creators of 100 Rogues were holding a monster-design contest, and the winning monster would be featured in the sequel.  How awesome is that?</p>
<p>I submitted two monsters.  I came up with the ideas early on, but I&#8217;ve been really busy, so I didn&#8217;t get around to sending them until the very last day, around 10 pm, from the airport returning from a trip.  Well, 10 pm Mountain Time; I believe they&#8217;re on the east coast, so depending on when the precise deadline was, I may have missed it after all.</p>
<p>Both of these are mundane critters.  This was intentional; I figured that wackier designs would run the risk of not really fitting in with the feel of the game.  Instead, I focused on how they would behave in the game: I wanted something unique, but simple and implementable, that the player would find challenging but not annoying.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the first submission: A Dog!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/100rogues-adog.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-34" title="100rogues-adog" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/100rogues-adog-223x300.png" alt="I'M A DOG!!" width="223" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I suspect the judges are rolling their eyes at this one.  Someone thought <em>a dog</em> was original?  A Dog isn&#8217;t the pinnacle of visual innovation, but it does some interesting stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, A Dog is sleeping.  If the player, or any enemy, comes within a four-tile range of A Dog, it will wake up.  (&#8220;Let sleeping dogs lie.&#8221;)</li>
<li>If awake, A Dog will attack the nearest target, and will continue attacking each target, in order of proximity, until there are no targets left in the room/corridor.  If it cannot see any target, it will go back to sleep.</li>
<li>A Dog can be tamed by throwing food at it.  (This might be tricky to implement.)  When tame, it will not attack you, and instead of sleeping when all targets are defeated, it will follow you.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of having a tame dog was inspired by the dog that you get in <a href="http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Dog">NetHack</a>, because it was fun to have a dog in that game.  Little did I realize that the meat-throwing thing is <em>exactly how you tame dogs in NetHack.</em> (I&#8217;d only ever had the starter dog.)  So instead of being original yet throwbacky, I inadvertently cribbed an old idea.  Man, I wish I&#8217;d done the research on that.  Lesson learned.</p>
<p>Maybe my other submission will fare better?  This here is Spearbill.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/100rogues-spearbill.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-35" title="100rogues-spearbill" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/100rogues-spearbill-211x300.png" alt="Honk." width="211" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Spearbill is a large, angry, flightless bird.  Here are its interesting-monster specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s fast!  It moves at double speed.  (Again, not sure how/if this can be implemented.)</li>
<li>Because of its speed and agile build, it is difficult to hit with long-range weapons.  However, it is built for agility, not defense: close-range attacks will do a lot of damage.  (This is the opposite of most flying enemies in 100 Rogues, which are easier to hit from a distance.)</li>
<li>After killing a Spearbill, the player can occasionally salvage its beak, which makes a good throwing weapon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe there&#8217;s a fast, evasive, beak-dropping bird already in existence, too, but I&#8217;m not aware of one.  Spearbill was my first idea, and I like it a little bit better.</p>
<p>I had a third idea that I didn&#8217;t end up submitting: a giant kitten made out of stone.  Giant because you cannot get around it, kitten because it is benign and will never attack you, stone because it is invincible.  It wouldn&#8217;t be a threat, just an impediment.  However, I decided Giant Stone Kitten would be too frustrating if it managed to get you stuck in a corner.</p>
<p>Both illustrations were done using <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/designandweb/2010/04/adobe_ideas.html">Adobe Ideas</a>, which is another app you should get.  It&#8217;s free, and it&#8217;s vector-based, which is so very cool: you draw a line with your finger, and even if it&#8217;s a little choppy, the app automatically smooths it into a vector.  So cool.  Its features are limited (you can&#8217;t save colors, which drives me nuts), but I love the overall experience &#8211; it feels close to pen and paper drawing..  (I plan to get <a href="http://www.brushesapp.com/">Brushes</a> soon, too, and I&#8217;m eager to see how the two apps compare.)</p>
