<p>I keep telling myself I don&#8217;t want to do webcomics, but half the stuff I draw happens to be in comic form.</p>
<p>Halfway through drawing this, I got the feeling that this joke has been done before. As a creative type, I sometimes worry about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptomnesia">cryptomnesia</a> showing up in my stuff. If that ever happens, tell me. I swear I won&#8217;t have meant it.</p>
<p>I will have some more bridge guy comics soon!</p>

<p>Bonus Cat has many ways to communicate that it&#8217;s time for breakfast. There&#8217;s the direct way, which involves hitting you in the face. The friendly/manipulative method of sitting next to you, purring, and sprinting off to the kitchen every time you shift your weight. The threat: chewing your scalp until you wake up, because you too are made of food.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the &#8220;I&#8217;m so starved I could eat <em>tape</em>&#8221; gambit.</p>

<p>He&#8217;ll find something with tape attached and start chewing. I don&#8217;t know why he considers tape nootrishus-n-tastee. Maybe he&#8217;s just doing it to get our attention and rouse pity. Tape is loud.</p>

<p>Has it been a week? Dear goodness. I was sick, and then I was on vacation, and since I&#8217;ve gotten back I&#8217;ve been really tired. I was working on a few things before all that, which I need to finish up. In the meantime, we&#8217;ll always have Skerple Friday!</p>
<p>I found some old old stuff that I doodled in one of my work notebooks from a previous job. True stories, here!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/oldcomic-mediocre.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-115" title="oldcomic-mediocre" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/oldcomic-mediocre.png" alt="" width="489" height="342" /></a></p>
<p>God didn&#8217;t actually stop by my desk and tell me to my face that I was mediocre, but I was thinking it. And then I really did hit my knee. I had to mention that part because it&#8217;s sort of illegible.</p>
<p>This one is a little more realistic, and I suppose a little more optimistic:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/oldcomic-nalgene.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-116" title="oldcomic-nalgene" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/oldcomic-nalgene.png" alt="" width="410" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>Switching to a bottle with a narrow neck solved this particular problem. Innovation!</p>
<p>I can tell it&#8217;s winter in these because I drew myself in pants and a fleece jacket. I am hoping I saved the on-hold-with-IRS comic I drew from around that time, too. It unravels into annoyed madness pretty quickly.</p>

<p>I was sick last week, and I&#8217;ve been having some trouble getting quality sleep this week, and I know I know NO EXCUSES, but it&#8217;s been a little tough to find the energy to draw or blog. I&#8217;m going on vacation this weekend, though! I&#8217;ll be able to practice drawing people in the airport. And the person sitting next to me on the plane will be like &#8220;ooh, you&#8217;re an artist? whatcha drawing?&#8221; and I&#8217;ll be all WHAT&#8217;S IT TO YA because I&#8217;m an introvert and pretty bad at socializing. I would like to preemptively apologize to the person sitting next to me on the plane.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/skerple-puff.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113" title="skerple-puff" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/skerple-puff.png" alt="" width="438" height="688" /></a>When I first moved to this town, I kept seeing a probably-feral cat sleeping in the lot next door. I tried to be his friend, but feral cats are about as friendly toward humans as I am to my hypothetical airplane seatmate.</p>
<p>He was all white and longhaired, which seems like the worst possible fur choice for a cat who lives on the street, except in winter. He had that kinda ugly feral cat face &#8211; you know what I&#8217;m talking about? Sort of a longer face with squinty eyes, less open and kittenish, more like a perpetually-irritated lion. And boy was he dirty. I started calling him Dirrty Puff.</p>
<p>Our cat, Bonus Cat, used to be a friend of his. One day I was looking out the window at Dirrty&#8217;s usual spot, and there was a bonus cat hanging out with him, hence the name.</p>
<p>The months went on. Bonus became our friend, but Dirrty decided to relocate operations so he wouldn&#8217;t be bothered by me. I stopped seeing him regularly, and then I stopped seeing him altogether. I saw him once that summer, and then I saw him in January, and that was it. I feared he&#8217;d died at some point during the winter, because he didn&#8217;t seem like a healthy cat to begin with (Bonus was cleaner and had much more energy, but it still took four weeks of medication to get him well enough to be neutered). I was sad about that, but you can&#8217;t help someone who doesn&#8217;t want to be helped.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was walking home two days ago, and I SAW DIRRTY PUFF. He was walking up a porch, looked at me, and ran off across the street in true Puff fashion. Same face and everything, but he looked a lot cleaner. Maybe he has somewhere to stay?</p>
<p>I tried to capture his face here, but it&#8217;s not right at all. Cats are hard enough to draw, more so from memory.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
<p>I mentioned in a previous entry that I am reading Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, and giving all of the exercises an honest effort. At the time of this posting, I’m about halfway through. I won’t blog a complete blow-by-blow, but I’ll post some highlights and my thoughts.</p>
<p>The first thing you’re supposed to do is a few “before” drawings in pencil. One of them is a self-portrait.</p>
<p>At this point, I’m tempted to skip through to the end and see if all we’re doing is drawing pencil portraits, because I’m really not a pencil-portrait kind of person. I think I got rid of all my drawing pencils years ago, even.</p>
<p>It took me a while to dig up a pencil of any variety, and was thrilled to find a 4B. I’m already ahead of you, book! Finding a pencil sharpener took another five minutes, and even then all I could rustle up was one intended for eyeliner pencils. Eyeliner pencils aren’t intended to be sharpened to a fine point. That’s okay. I don’t need a fine point. I’m an artist.</p>
<p>So here goes.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/selfportrait.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105" title="selfportrait" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/selfportrait.jpg" alt="" width="181" height="398" /></a></p>
<p>I’m hesitant to put my face online, so I’m only showing part of the drawing. Enough so you can tell I’m not a horrible artist, but not enough so you can identify me. Which may be beside the point, because my boyfriend says it doesn’t really look like me anyway. My eyes are crooked in this drawing, and I knew it, but I didn’t have an eraser.</p>
<p>Next you are supposed to draw a person from memory. I drew Gordon Ramsay, because we’ve been watching a lot of Kitchen Nightmares and I figure I’d remember him okay.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/gordonramsay.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106" title="gordonramsay" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/gordonramsay.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="633" /></a></p>
<p>In the British edition of Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon changes shirts in front of the camera at least twice per episode, and he doesn’t wear undershirts. In the American edition, people are too busy fighting to learn how to cook, let alone change clothes. Like, Gordon Ramsay should do an evalutation of the American edition of his own damn show and tell the producers that it’s rubbish and then instruct them how to clean up the dramatic music, fire the narrator, and focus on a rustic production with real cooking, or something.</p>
<p>The final “before” drawing is of your hand. Presumably because the face ain’t listening.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/hand.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107" title="hand" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/hand.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="523" /></a><br />
One day I will evolve opposable thumbs.</p>
<p>Other than the short thumb, this isn’t really the worst drawing ever. I could have gone back over it with an eraser, if I’d had one, and made the shading all smooth and pretty. Instead I was like “yeah, that’s a reasonable sketch of a hand.”</p>
<p>I timed myself on the last two drawings. I didn’t think of it for the first one. You’re supposed to set aside half an hour for each drawing, and going slower might have helped me, but I’d like to be able to draw my hand faster than I can run a mile. If I’m going to be drawing a lot, I’d like to be efficient.</p>
<p>So far I’m still on the fence on the book’s usefulness. I don’t think I’m its target audience; what I want to learn and what this book tries to teach don’t overlap completely. I think it’s a good refresher for me, as far as observation and concentration are concerned, but I haven’t yet discovered anything that has revolutionized my ways of perceiving. I’ve drawn from life before, not with perfect accuracy but reasonably well, and I’m familiar with viewing objects as a collection of shapes and lines and planes instead of trying to make them fit preconceptions.</p>
<p>However, at this point I’m still a little resistant to the book’s message: it focuses on realism in drawing, and I enjoy drawing with a more cartoony feel (what’s the correct term here? Partial abstraction? I should know this!), and I want the two to inform each other. The author keeps telling us that we need to abandon our symbolic vocabulary. If the symbols don’t work, then yes, throw ‘em out. But unless you draw only from life, you will need symbols. Symbols that are developed through observation, but symbols all the same. I want to be able to draw the same nose from any angle with one or two lines, and you can’t do that without having a comprehensive mental library of working symbols.</p>
<p>I’m guessing this will all come together later, or in a different book with a different focus.</p>

<p>One more Cave Story comic and I am done. I started this last week, before the Skerple Misery series.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/dancestory.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-110" title="dancestory" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/dancestory.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="1505" /></a>By way of explanation, the little yellow triangles you get when you defeat enemies remind me of tortilla chips, and the antenna things on the robot guys&#8217; ears remind me of headphones. So this comic probably makes sense only to me, and comes across as completely bizarre to everyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I drew this in Photoshop using a tablet. I found the tablet awkward at first, but I want to get comfortable with it.</p>

<p>Time for another muggy six hours of marching band practice. You guys brought your sunscreen and thermoses of Mountain Dew, right?</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-marktiming.jpg"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-marktiming1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-97" title="mandy-marktiming" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-marktiming1.jpg" alt="" width="346" height="260" /></a></a></p>
<p>The present participle of &#8220;mark time&#8221; is &#8220;mark timing,&#8221; according to everyone else in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">march banding</span> marching band. That drove me crazy. And of course they&#8217;re not doing it right because they&#8217;re trying to march in 7.391/4 time and no one bothered to give anyone in the colorguard a copy of the score.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-fat.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-98" title="mandy-fat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-fat.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="476" /></a></p>
<p>I was the fattest flag girl. Or I thought I was, even though I was nearly identical in size to one of our captains. From the bleachers you couldn&#8217;t tell any of us apart anyway. No one&#8217;s even looking at you, they&#8217;re looking at the helicopter toss you just dropped.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like the way I drew the two foreground girls in panel two. They shouldn&#8217;t be the same height and they shouldn&#8217;t be exactly side by side &#8211; it looks flat and amateurish. I tried to tilt the shoulders a little bit, but I don&#8217;t think it worked out. I need to work on drawing people from the back in general. Teenage Girl turned out pretty good though.</p>

<p>Band is its own little social hierarchy within the larger high school hierarchy. I like how Mandy&#8217;s shirt looks like it says &#8220;frogs.&#8221; Let&#8217;s go OHS Frogs!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s marching band season. Fortunately, I haven&#8217;t had to think about marching band season for over a decade, except in occasional nightmares.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-full.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89" title="mandy-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-full.jpg" alt="" width="308" height="472" /></a></p>
<p>I decided to do a few quick doodles about a former flag girl returning to her alma mater to pass on her wisdom and bitterness.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-revenge.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90" title="mandy-revenge" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-revenge.jpg" alt="" width="487" height="205" /></a></p>
<p>I would actually really like to return to flag twirling. I would also actually really like to yell at my high school band director.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-thisyear.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91" title="mandy-thisyear" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-thisyear.jpg" alt="" width="272" height="442" /></a></p>
<p>If you must doodle, doodle somewhere else.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-intro.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92" title="mandy-intro" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mandy-intro.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>One of the things I want (and <em>really need</em>) to work on is the ability to draw characters in action and from multiple angles.</p>
<p>More tomorrow!</p>
