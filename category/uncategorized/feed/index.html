				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have really been phoning my Skerple Fridays in lately. It&#8217;s hard for me to do much in the morning that isn&#8217;t sleeping or drinking coffee. And Friday&#8217;s my busiest day at work so I&#8217;m already not inclined to be up and doing things. It doesn&#8217;t look good to have pages full of quarter-assed skerplings and nothing else, but I keep going because it keeps me updating even when I have nothing else. It&#8217;s like going to the gym once a week and spending ten minutes on the Air-Dyne so you can say you work out.</p>
<p>You know how everyone on the internet gets fascinated by the same thing at the same time? Yesterday it was that big chart of cat colors. I am a nerd and knew about most of it already, but what I didn&#8217;t know is that the piebald spotting gene breaks up the areas of color while the cat is still an embryo. Like continental drift. So I&#8217;ve been teasing Bonus Cat about being too fat for his embryo.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-fatcat.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-246" title="skerple-fatcat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-fatcat.png" alt="" width="322" height="178" /></a>(There&#8217;s that line from the scanner again. I don&#8217;t feel like dealing with it right now, but I&#8217;m tired of seeing it.)</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-cathycat.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-247" title="skerple-cathycat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-cathycat.png" alt="" width="392" height="277" /></a>I wonder if the time to make fun of Cathy is over. I hope not.</p>
<p>Everyone on the internet who wasn&#8217;t interested in cat fur was talking about the supposed thirteenth astrological sign, Snake Guy. I&#8217;m surprised at how possessive people are of their signs. You&#8217;d think it&#8217;d be awesome to be represented by a guy with a snake. He&#8217;s got a snake!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-snakeguy.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-248" title="skerple-snakeguy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-snakeguy.png" alt="" width="274" height="285" /></a>It&#8217;s not like the stars intend to be in the shape of a snake guy, though. It&#8217;s how someone interpreted them long ago, and no one&#8217;s challenged it because things-to-look-at technology has advanced to the point where we no longer need to look at stars. For all I know, my sign could really be Baseball Guy.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-baseballguy.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249" title="skerple-baseballguy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/skerple-baseballguy.png" alt="" width="274" height="285" /></a>Now I want to draw Cathy parodies and new zodiac signs, but I have to go to work. Maybe over the weekend?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the Clash of the Titans remake earlier this year, the kraken has gotten a lot of attention. It&#8217;s always <em>The Kraken</em>, like there&#8217;s only one. I suspect &#8220;kraken&#8221; is a title, and each ocean holds an election every four years in which all mature cephalopods may vote. The bottom of the sea is littered with<em> Glurp for Kraken &#8217;72</em> signs. Octopuses in general seem to be trendy this year, same as owls, and I&#8217;m a little disappointed because critters shouldn&#8217;t be trendy. I am going to be totally into praying mantises in 2011 before the hipsters catch on. You heard it here first.</p>
<p>But for now, I still like making kraken jokes.</p>

Seafood and cheese kind of really don&#8217;t go together. I hope you weren&#8217;t eating breakfast.</p>
<p>But if you were, here&#8217;s a months-old kraken drawing from my sketchbook for you:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Bravest Ever: a blog of art, writing, and other creative works in progress.</p>
<p>A little bit of backstory: I’ve always enjoyed creating things.  When I was young, I wanted to be a writer or an artist.  As I got older, I decided graphic design would be a good match.  I honestly intended to pursue one of these paths&#8230; but I never did.  I was scared.  I was afraid to show people my stuff, because I didn’t think I was any good.</p>
<p>In the years since, my creative pursuits have been relegated to “hobbies” or “dabbling” or “what I did on my lunch break.”  I still wasn’t confident enough to take my work seriously, and I didn’t mentally invest in it.  I’ve spent the last several years trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, under the assumption that I didn’t have any special talents or interests.  Only recently did it hit me: I’ve known what I wanted all this time, I’ve just been too scared to pursue it.</p>
<p>So I figure it’s finally time for me to be brave.</p>
<p>This blog is more of an open notebook than a portfolio; I’m figuring things out as I go along.  Not everything here will be great.  A lot of it will be rough around the edges.  Some of it may be genuinely bad.  But as long as it’s worth trying, and as long as I learn from it, it’s not junk.</p>
<p>I’d love to hear from you; email me at bravestever@gmail.com or find me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/TheBravestEver">@TheBravestEver</a>.  I&#8217;ll answer any questions, and maybe take requests.</p>
