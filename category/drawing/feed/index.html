				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you seen the <a href="http://dumbrunningsonic.tumblr.com/">Dumb Running Sonic</a> tumblr? It&#8217;s my new favorite meme. So favorite that I decided to make my own Dumb Sonic. My first ever animated gif!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dumb-animated.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-283" title="dumb-animated" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dumb-animated.gif" alt="hurr durr fart" width="400" height="282" /></a>I used a pretty neato iPad app called <a href="http://www.kdanmobile.com/en/animation-desk/">Animation Desk</a>. It doesn&#8217;t automatically export animations to .gif format &#8211; that requires some minor tweaking in Photoshop &#8211; but it&#8217;s easy to use and super fun.</p>
<p>I see a lot of dumb animated gifs in my future, because they&#8217;re fun.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[My interpretation of Lovecraftian monsters based on what I know of Lovecraft: practically nothing.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day Jim and I were talking about the works of H.P. Lovecraft. I&#8217;ve never read any Lovecraft, but I know a couple things:</p>
<ul>
<li>he lived in Providence</li>
<li>he wrote about a guy named Cthulhu</li>
<li>who lives in R&#8217;lyeh and often fhtagns, wherever and whatever that is</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are a bunch of other dread creatures who possess earth-destroying power, but are usually dumb or fast asleep and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re not dead yet. They are all eye-meltingly hideous, and their names are pronounced in the same way you&#8217;d hock a loogie.</p>
<p>Anyway, I drew what I imagine a Lovecraft story to be like:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been trying to establish doodling as a daily habit. Some of the things I&#8217;ve done in the last week or so:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-babies.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261" title="040111-babies" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-babies.jpg" alt="" width="127" height="463" /></a>Babbys, and half a preschooler.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-mustachecouch.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-263" title="040111-mustachecouch" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-mustachecouch.jpg" alt="" width="361" height="162" /></a>A hipster couch.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-steampunkarmchair.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264" title="040111-steampunkarmchair" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-steampunkarmchair.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="187" /></a>I still find inappropriately steampunked objects disproportionately amusing.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-livingroom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262" title="040111-livingroom" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-livingroom.jpg" alt="" width="452" height="304" /></a>I need to practice backgrounds. I hate drawing them, but I love seeing them well-done. I threw a George Booth dog in there before I realized I have no memory of what George Booth dogs actually look like.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-predisents.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265" title="040111-predisents" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-predisents.jpg" alt="" width="381" height="204" /></a>A good exercise is to try and draw famous people from memory. These are the money guy and, um, I clearly don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-tinyart.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266" title="040111-tinyart" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-tinyart.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="238" /></a>I got <a href="http://www.muji.us/store/stationery/pen-pencil/gel-ink-ballpoint-pen-hexagonal-0-4mm.html">a lovely new pen from Muji</a> a couple months ago and it is the best pen and I love it. This scan doesn&#8217;t capture the greatness that is this pen, or the smallness that is Tiny Art Boy. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to draw little tiny things with nice pens on nice paper. Maybe I can make a career out of selling drawings the size of my thumbnail.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, my <a href="http://www.arthousecoop.com/projects/sketchbookproject">Sketchbook Project</a> sketchbook is done! Or, at least, I filled all the pages and actually mailed the thing in. I kept putting it off, and when I did work on it I didn&#8217;t put a whole ton into it. All my sketches were loose and penciled, and in many of them you can tell I&#8217;m still figuring out the blocking and proportions of everything. There&#8217;s something about the point when an activity becomes an obligation that really throws me.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mostimportant.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-253" title="vengeance-mostimportant" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mostimportant.png" alt="" width="449" height="772" /></a></p>
<p>The part I really liked was creating the narrative. In Vengeance Bus, two surly young women buy an old school bus and a megaphone and go around telling off the people who&#8217;ve wronged them. Most of the story is the two heroines sniping about things, getting irritated with each other, and being totally unable to navigate a bus through a crowded city.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mintyandjules.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254" title="vengeance-mintyandjules" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mintyandjules.png" alt="" width="458" height="664" /></a></p>
<p>Julie, the surlier of the two vengeancers, ended up being a lot chunkier than my <a href="/2010/11/a-season-of-vengeance/">sketch from a couple months ago</a>. I like creating heavier characters, because I&#8217;ve been heavier for most of my life, and I like having characters I can relate to. Not only that, but it&#8217;s hard to find female characters who aren&#8217;t beautiful. Either they&#8217;re eye-candy romantic interests, or they&#8217;re chicklit everygirls who are supposed to be just like you, except they&#8217;re played by someone like Anne Hathaway, and you&#8217;re supposed to either pretend that looking like Anne Hathaway is totally normal, or start thinking that maybe you too look like Anne Hathaway. If I wrote more (or any) fiction, and maybe I should, quite a few of my female protagonists would be thoroughly unremarkable-looking, and not terribly bothered by that fact.</p>
<p>Anyway, my initial vision was to have the sketchbook mostly fleshed out and resembling a graphic novel; that didn&#8217;t happen. I knew that was a lofty goal. I do think I should have put a little more care into the drawing. As of right now I&#8217;m considering Vengeance But a publicly viewable super-rough draft, and heavily considering working on a more polished version.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s like two feet of snow here, and it&#8217;s probably going to be hanging around and growing increasingly grungy until mid-March. I hate winter. So I decided to draw a beach scene.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-smokingcrabs.png"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-smokingcrabs1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-237" title="skerple-smokingcrabs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-smokingcrabs1.png" alt="" width="436" height="440" /></a></a></p>
<p>Except&#8230; Crabs, what are you doing?! <a href="http://soundcloud.com/isilence/crab-why-do-you-smoke">Why do you smoke</a>? You&#8217;re crabs! And you&#8217;re polluting the air and the beach!</p>
<p>I doodled a drug-awareness scene from the eighties, too. Growing up in the eighties meant being constantly vigilant of cool kids who would stop at nothing to get you to take drugs.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-wantsomedrugs.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-238" title="skerple-wantsomedrugs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-wantsomedrugs.png" alt="" width="450" height="466" /></a></p>
<p>And then they&#8217;d show you all their drugs, which would be, like, a beer, a cigarette, assorted pills, and some weird stuff that they don&#8217;t explain and you wouldn&#8217;t know what to do with.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-justonedrug.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-239" title="skerple-justonedrug" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/skerple-justonedrug.png" alt="" width="450" height="311" /></a>I get the sense I&#8217;ve doodled about the hilarious 80s drug videos before, but I don&#8217;t think I have. I think it&#8217;s just something I like making fun of, but hadn&#8217;t skerped to paper yet.</p>

<p>And thank you, thank you, thank you for reading Bravest Ever. I know my blog doesn&#8217;t have a huge audience, but I&#8217;m thrilled to no longer be doodling in a vacuum, and it means a lot to me when I hear that someone&#8217;s been reading and enjoying it. It&#8217;s still scary to put myself out there, but it&#8217;s getting better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because &#8217;tis the season, here&#8217;s a special holiday comic:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/trickortreat.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-230" title="trickortreat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/trickortreat.png" alt="" width="211" height="772" /></a>I didn&#8217;t specify <em>which</em> holiday.</p>
<p>I drew this pretty hastily around Halloween, when our computers got stolen and I couldn&#8217;t scan it. I like it enough to share off-season.</p>
<p>The thing about comics that I&#8217;ve discovered since starting this blog is that it can be a challenge to make things visually legible. It&#8217;s like learning a new language with its own grammar and vocabulary. Other forms of art and writing can leave room for interpretation, but if you&#8217;re ambiguous in a comic you risk losing the punchline. When I drew this, I intended Ninja Turtle Girl to be yelling for her offscreen mom to help her with the scary lady, but afterwards I realized it could also (and more likely) be read as the scary lady being her mom, which I like a little better.</p>
<p>Bravest Ever will be on a short vacation; I&#8217;ll be back after Christmas. Enjoy whatever excuse to eat candy you celebrate!</p>
