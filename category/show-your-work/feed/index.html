				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been trying to establish doodling as a daily habit. Some of the things I&#8217;ve done in the last week or so:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-babies.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261" title="040111-babies" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-babies.jpg" alt="" width="127" height="463" /></a>Babbys, and half a preschooler.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-mustachecouch.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-263" title="040111-mustachecouch" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-mustachecouch.jpg" alt="" width="361" height="162" /></a>A hipster couch.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-steampunkarmchair.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264" title="040111-steampunkarmchair" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-steampunkarmchair.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="187" /></a>I still find inappropriately steampunked objects disproportionately amusing.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-livingroom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262" title="040111-livingroom" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-livingroom.jpg" alt="" width="452" height="304" /></a>I need to practice backgrounds. I hate drawing them, but I love seeing them well-done. I threw a George Booth dog in there before I realized I have no memory of what George Booth dogs actually look like.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-predisents.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265" title="040111-predisents" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-predisents.jpg" alt="" width="381" height="204" /></a>A good exercise is to try and draw famous people from memory. These are the money guy and, um, I clearly don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-tinyart.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266" title="040111-tinyart" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/040111-tinyart.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="238" /></a>I got <a href="http://www.muji.us/store/stationery/pen-pencil/gel-ink-ballpoint-pen-hexagonal-0-4mm.html">a lovely new pen from Muji</a> a couple months ago and it is the best pen and I love it. This scan doesn&#8217;t capture the greatness that is this pen, or the smallness that is Tiny Art Boy. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to draw little tiny things with nice pens on nice paper. Maybe I can make a career out of selling drawings the size of my thumbnail.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, my <a href="http://www.arthousecoop.com/projects/sketchbookproject">Sketchbook Project</a> sketchbook is done! Or, at least, I filled all the pages and actually mailed the thing in. I kept putting it off, and when I did work on it I didn&#8217;t put a whole ton into it. All my sketches were loose and penciled, and in many of them you can tell I&#8217;m still figuring out the blocking and proportions of everything. There&#8217;s something about the point when an activity becomes an obligation that really throws me.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mostimportant.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-253" title="vengeance-mostimportant" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mostimportant.png" alt="" width="449" height="772" /></a></p>
<p>The part I really liked was creating the narrative. In Vengeance Bus, two surly young women buy an old school bus and a megaphone and go around telling off the people who&#8217;ve wronged them. Most of the story is the two heroines sniping about things, getting irritated with each other, and being totally unable to navigate a bus through a crowded city.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mintyandjules.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254" title="vengeance-mintyandjules" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vengeance-mintyandjules.png" alt="" width="458" height="664" /></a></p>
<p>Julie, the surlier of the two vengeancers, ended up being a lot chunkier than my <a href="/2010/11/a-season-of-vengeance/">sketch from a couple months ago</a>. I like creating heavier characters, because I&#8217;ve been heavier for most of my life, and I like having characters I can relate to. Not only that, but it&#8217;s hard to find female characters who aren&#8217;t beautiful. Either they&#8217;re eye-candy romantic interests, or they&#8217;re chicklit everygirls who are supposed to be just like you, except they&#8217;re played by someone like Anne Hathaway, and you&#8217;re supposed to either pretend that looking like Anne Hathaway is totally normal, or start thinking that maybe you too look like Anne Hathaway. If I wrote more (or any) fiction, and maybe I should, quite a few of my female protagonists would be thoroughly unremarkable-looking, and not terribly bothered by that fact.</p>
<p>Anyway, my initial vision was to have the sketchbook mostly fleshed out and resembling a graphic novel; that didn&#8217;t happen. I knew that was a lofty goal. I do think I should have put a little more care into the drawing. As of right now I&#8217;m considering Vengeance But a publicly viewable super-rough draft, and heavily considering working on a more polished version.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple things from the sketchbook. Apropos of nothing, here&#8217;s me in a Slanket.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/slanket.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164" title="slanket" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/slanket.png" alt="" width="400" height="437" /></a>No, emphatically <em>not</em> a Snuggie. Are you crazy? Snuggies suck.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a chubby sad kid:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sadfatkid.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-165" title="sadfatkid" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sadfatkid.png" alt="" width="500" height="388" /></a>I default to three-quarters view when drawing people, because it&#8217;s the easiest. Less foreshortening, and profiles are just trouble. The head-on view looks a lot flatter here.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I think the 3/4 view is fairly common in cartooning. I may have absorbed that.</p>
<p>More sad kids:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/searsboys.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-166" title="searsboys" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/searsboys.png" alt="" width="500" height="347" /></a>Remember at Sears how they had kids&#8217; sizes in slim, regular, and &#8220;husky?&#8221; I felt bad for both the slim and the husky boys, but kind of especially bad for the huskies. How can anyone say &#8220;husky boy&#8221; with a straight face? Then again, I recall some of my clothes were &#8220;Pretty Plus.&#8221; That might be worse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned in a previous entry that I am reading Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, and giving all of the exercises an honest effort. At the time of this posting, I’m about halfway through. I won’t blog a complete blow-by-blow, but I’ll post some highlights and my thoughts.</p>
<p>The first thing you’re supposed to do is a few “before” drawings in pencil. One of them is a self-portrait.</p>
<p>At this point, I’m tempted to skip through to the end and see if all we’re doing is drawing pencil portraits, because I’m really not a pencil-portrait kind of person. I think I got rid of all my drawing pencils years ago, even.</p>
<p>It took me a while to dig up a pencil of any variety, and was thrilled to find a 4B. I’m already ahead of you, book! Finding a pencil sharpener took another five minutes, and even then all I could rustle up was one intended for eyeliner pencils. Eyeliner pencils aren’t intended to be sharpened to a fine point. That’s okay. I don’t need a fine point. I’m an artist.</p>
<p>So here goes.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/selfportrait.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105" title="selfportrait" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/selfportrait.jpg" alt="" width="181" height="398" /></a></p>
<p>I’m hesitant to put my face online, so I’m only showing part of the drawing. Enough so you can tell I’m not a horrible artist, but not enough so you can identify me. Which may be beside the point, because my boyfriend says it doesn’t really look like me anyway. My eyes are crooked in this drawing, and I knew it, but I didn’t have an eraser.</p>
<p>Next you are supposed to draw a person from memory. I drew Gordon Ramsay, because we’ve been watching a lot of Kitchen Nightmares and I figure I’d remember him okay.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/gordonramsay.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106" title="gordonramsay" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/gordonramsay.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="633" /></a></p>
<p>In the British edition of Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon changes shirts in front of the camera at least twice per episode, and he doesn’t wear undershirts. In the American edition, people are too busy fighting to learn how to cook, let alone change clothes. Like, Gordon Ramsay should do an evalutation of the American edition of his own damn show and tell the producers that it’s rubbish and then instruct them how to clean up the dramatic music, fire the narrator, and focus on a rustic production with real cooking, or something.</p>
<p>The final “before” drawing is of your hand. Presumably because the face ain’t listening.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/hand.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107" title="hand" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/hand.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="523" /></a><br />
One day I will evolve opposable thumbs.</p>
<p>Other than the short thumb, this isn’t really the worst drawing ever. I could have gone back over it with an eraser, if I’d had one, and made the shading all smooth and pretty. Instead I was like “yeah, that’s a reasonable sketch of a hand.”</p>
<p>I timed myself on the last two drawings. I didn’t think of it for the first one. You’re supposed to set aside half an hour for each drawing, and going slower might have helped me, but I’d like to be able to draw my hand faster than I can run a mile. If I’m going to be drawing a lot, I’d like to be efficient.</p>
<p>So far I’m still on the fence on the book’s usefulness. I don’t think I’m its target audience; what I want to learn and what this book tries to teach don’t overlap completely. I think it’s a good refresher for me, as far as observation and concentration are concerned, but I haven’t yet discovered anything that has revolutionized my ways of perceiving. I’ve drawn from life before, not with perfect accuracy but reasonably well, and I’m familiar with viewing objects as a collection of shapes and lines and planes instead of trying to make them fit preconceptions.</p>
<p>However, at this point I’m still a little resistant to the book’s message: it focuses on realism in drawing, and I enjoy drawing with a more cartoony feel (what’s the correct term here? Partial abstraction? I should know this!), and I want the two to inform each other. The author keeps telling us that we need to abandon our symbolic vocabulary. If the symbols don’t work, then yes, throw ‘em out. But unless you draw only from life, you will need symbols. Symbols that are developed through observation, but symbols all the same. I want to be able to draw the same nose from any angle with one or two lines, and you can’t do that without having a comprehensive mental library of working symbols.</p>
<p>I’m guessing this will all come together later, or in a different book with a different focus.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imaginary products make me giggle.  I&#8217;ve got a few fake ads for fake products kicking around in my mind, and I’ll be working on putting them to paper.</p>
<p>I’ve got a few snapshots of some lunch-break doodles:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cerealkids.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-47" title="Can't get enough of insert-cereal-here!" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cerealkids-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Here are some kids who love an imaginary breakfast cereal.  Animated cereal commercials always have exactly two kids, a boy and a girl, who rollerblade for the munchy chomp of their preferred cereal.  As I recall, all cereal kids in a given decade look alike.  There could be only one Boy Kid/Girl Kid team out there, and they spend hours every Saturday morning simultaneously chasing after Lucky Charms and keeping their box of Trix away from the rabbit.  They&#8217;re greedy, but they&#8217;re keeping fit.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;ve got to look fit, rather than bloated from simple carbs and refined sugars, but you&#8217;ve still got to give them that rounded kid look.  Kids have almost cylindrical-looking torsos.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cerealkids2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-48" title="Jellybeans!" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cerealkids2-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m having trouble getting the look right from memory, though the top center head is close.  Adding irises to the eyes makes a big difference.   I’m going to have to do some research into cereal-kid art styles.  I’ve been putting that off, because it’ll almost certainly entail watching cereal ads until my eyes fall out.</p>
