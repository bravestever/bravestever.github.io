				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve decided to discontinue Skerple Fridays. They&#8217;ve kept me posting when I&#8217;ve had nothing else, which has been a good thing. However, trying to draw something, scan it, and write a post about it in the half hour before work has proven to be a fairly tall order, and most weeks I&#8217;m just scratching something off in thirty seconds so I can be done with it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be replacing Skerple Friday with some other sort of weekly post. Likely a weekly roundup of scans from my sketchbook. I&#8217;ll have an announcement and first post in the next few days.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;ll leave you with this recipe for bee salad:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/beesalad.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-257" title="beesalad" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/beesalad.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="207" /></a>3 cups worker bees (fresh is best, but dried will do in a pinch)<br />
1 cup broccoli florets<br />
1/4 cup diced red pepper<br />
1/4 cup diced onions<br />
1 cup mayonnaise<br />
2 teaspoons ground mustard<br />
1 teaspoon paprika</p>
<p>Combine all ingredients, stir well, and serve chilled.</p>
<p>For  Three Bee Salad, use one cup honeybees, one cup bumblebees,  and one cup garbanzo bees. If you are using soy bee substitute, reduce  mayonnaise to 3/4 cup.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry, y&#8217;all, no Skerple Friday today. Last night some jerk broke into our house and ran off with both our laptops and the iPad. Updates might be scarce for a while.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the end of the world for us, materially or mentally, so we&#8217;re awfully fortunate.</p>
<p>However, I had some works in progress saved on my laptop, including a comic that was so close to being done. I was looking forward to finishing it last night and sharing it here, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever get that chance. The police say the odds of my laptop being recovered are slim, and even if I do get it back, the thieves usually wipe everything so they can sell it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so mad about that.</p>
<p>I will start over when I get the chance. In the meantime (spoiler alert!), if in the near future you see the word <strong>Excalivetica</strong> anywhere not in connection with my blog, that might be the bastard who took my computer.</p>
