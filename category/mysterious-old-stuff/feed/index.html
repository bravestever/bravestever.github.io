				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Has it been a week? Dear goodness. I was sick, and then I was on vacation, and since I&#8217;ve gotten back I&#8217;ve been really tired. I was working on a few things before all that, which I need to finish up. In the meantime, we&#8217;ll always have Skerple Friday!</p>
<p>I found some old old stuff that I doodled in one of my work notebooks from a previous job. True stories, here!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/oldcomic-mediocre.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-115" title="oldcomic-mediocre" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/oldcomic-mediocre.png" alt="" width="489" height="342" /></a></p>
<p>God didn&#8217;t actually stop by my desk and tell me to my face that I was mediocre, but I was thinking it. And then I really did hit my knee. I had to mention that part because it&#8217;s sort of illegible.</p>
<p>This one is a little more realistic, and I suppose a little more optimistic:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/oldcomic-nalgene.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-116" title="oldcomic-nalgene" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/oldcomic-nalgene.png" alt="" width="410" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>Switching to a bottle with a narrow neck solved this particular problem. Innovation!</p>
<p>I can tell it&#8217;s winter in these because I drew myself in pants and a fleece jacket. I am hoping I saved the on-hold-with-IRS comic I drew from around that time, too. It unravels into annoyed madness pretty quickly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month I took a trip, and I flew JetBlue. I pick JetBlue whenever it fits my schedule and budget, because they have lots of snacks and everyone gets a TV in the seat. I didn&#8217;t get cussed out by a flight attendant or witness any epic flounces via emergency slide, but it was an enjoyable flight all the same.</p>
<p>Except I think JetBlue has some sort of deal with Progressive insurance, because they kept airing Progressive commercials right after their mandatory &#8220;enjoy the flight&#8221; bit.  Then they&#8217;d finally give you control of your little monitor, so you could watch ancient Ozzy videos on VH1, and I guess Progressive just buys a ton of ad space, because I swear I saw Flo every twenty minutes for the whole five hours.</p>
<p>And they say, draw what you know.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/omginsurance1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78" title="omginsurance" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/omginsurance1.png" alt="" width="375" height="396" /></a></p>
<p>You are supposed to find her cute, but she is really creepy. I keep waiting for her to hook up with that scary Mr. Opportunity guy:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mr-oprtunety1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-80" title="mr-oprtunety" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mr-oprtunety1.png" alt="" width="358" height="523" /></a>Do you think Honda knows their clearance mascot is annoying and frightening? I suspect they do and are trying to work a so-awful-he&#8217;s-endearing angle.</p>
<p>The Mr. Oprtunety doodle above is about two years old. I used to have a job where I saw that guy a lot.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re behind on the blog bill, ma&#8217;am.  We&#8217;re here to take your Charmander.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/charmander_repossessed.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-51" title="charmander_repossessed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/charmander_repossessed-250x300.jpg" alt="Why??" width="250" height="300" /></a>Another old doodle from I don&#8217;t know when.  I don&#8217;t even recall the gag behind this.  The repo man&#8217;s legs are wonky but everything else is generally okay.  I&#8217;ve got a lot of work to do on drawing cartoon people in motion.  I don&#8217;t like seeing stiff, flat, awkward characters in other people&#8217;s work, so there&#8217;s no reason I should stand for it in mine.</p>
<p>I want to get away from drawing Pokémon for a while, because it&#8217;s more challenging and valuable to draw real-world stuff.  I&#8217;m making an effort to draw at least something every day, no matter how small.</p>
