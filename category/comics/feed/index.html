		<description><![CDATA[My interpretation of Lovecraftian monsters based on what I know of Lovecraft: practically nothing.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day Jim and I were talking about the works of H.P. Lovecraft. I&#8217;ve never read any Lovecraft, but I know a couple things:</p>
<ul>
<li>he lived in Providence</li>
<li>he wrote about a guy named Cthulhu</li>
<li>who lives in R&#8217;lyeh and often fhtagns, wherever and whatever that is</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are a bunch of other dread creatures who possess earth-destroying power, but are usually dumb or fast asleep and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re not dead yet. They are all eye-meltingly hideous, and their names are pronounced in the same way you&#8217;d hock a loogie.</p>
<p>Anyway, I drew what I imagine a Lovecraft story to be like:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because &#8217;tis the season, here&#8217;s a special holiday comic:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/trickortreat.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-230" title="trickortreat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/trickortreat.png" alt="" width="211" height="772" /></a>I didn&#8217;t specify <em>which</em> holiday.</p>
<p>I drew this pretty hastily around Halloween, when our computers got stolen and I couldn&#8217;t scan it. I like it enough to share off-season.</p>
<p>The thing about comics that I&#8217;ve discovered since starting this blog is that it can be a challenge to make things visually legible. It&#8217;s like learning a new language with its own grammar and vocabulary. Other forms of art and writing can leave room for interpretation, but if you&#8217;re ambiguous in a comic you risk losing the punchline. When I drew this, I intended Ninja Turtle Girl to be yelling for her offscreen mom to help her with the scary lady, but afterwards I realized it could also (and more likely) be read as the scary lady being her mom, which I like a little better.</p>
<p>Bravest Ever will be on a short vacation; I&#8217;ll be back after Christmas. Enjoy whatever excuse to eat candy you celebrate!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My mom had a subscription to <em>The New Yorker</em> when I was a kid. I borrowed them because I liked the cartoons. At least, I liked the ones I understood. Roz Chast was my favorite because her cartoons were the most frequently gettable. A lot of the others were over my ten-year-old head.</p>
<p>I later grew up, got my own subscription, and figured out that <em>New Yorker </em>cartoons are usually over most adults&#8217; heads, too.</p>
<p>In the back of my mind, I always wanted to be a<em> New Yorker</em> cartoonist. It was one of those idle wants, rather than a realistic goal; otherwise, I&#8217;d be better by now. Generally, when people say, &#8220;I wish I could do that,&#8221; they mean &#8220;without having to put in the required work.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I have what they&#8217;re looking for, anyway, content-wise. I tend to make jokes about old memes&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/new-yorker-cheezburger.png"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/new-yorker-cheezburger1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-220" title="new-yorker-cheezburger" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/new-yorker-cheezburger1.png" alt="" width="500" height="371" /></a><br />
</a>And I have a feeling there&#8217;s not much overlap between the readership of <em>The New Yorker</em> and that of <em>Nintendo Power</em>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorker-squirtle.png"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorker-squirtle1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-219" title="newyorker-squirtle" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorker-squirtle1.png" alt="" width="499" height="343" /></a></a>I drew a different version of the Squirtle cartoon a couple years ago, but wasn&#8217;t completely satisfied with it. In that one, they were on a life raft, but I&#8217;ve since learned that the desert island setting is apparently a <em>New Yorker</em> clich√©, so a change of venue was obviously in order.</p>
<p>What are you supposed to cartoon about? Probably lawyers or something. The stock market. Adult relationships. Dinner parties. Self-aware but affectionate jokes about the absurdities of life in Manhattan: something about cabs or traffic, $900 shoes.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorker-shoes-2.png"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorker-shoes-21.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-218" title="newyorker-shoes-2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorker-shoes-21.png" alt="" width="508" height="340" /></a><br />
</a>I think Marisa Marchetto might have already done that one.</p>
<p>There are a lot of dogs in <em>New Yorker</em> cartoons, too, as I recall. I was going to draw a dog at a big executive desk saying something like &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m a dog.&#8221; But then I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I also read the tiny black and white ads in the margins, near the back. Everyone can understand ads! They were always for things that were expensive and unnecessary and hard to find &#8211; not enough to make them seem particularly luxurious, but just enough to seem silly. Since this was a couple decades ago, you couldn&#8217;t order anything online. You looked at the tiny ad and, I guess, called the number with credit card in hand or mailed a check to the address. I always wondered who did that, and if people at the library stopped them and said, &#8220;Oh! Is that the whale pin that was in <em>The New Yorker</em>? It&#8217;s very sophisticated. Yes, I read it too! Let&#8217;s be sophisticated friends.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorkerad-whale1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-223" title="newyorkerad-whale" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorkerad-whale1.png" alt="" width="350" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/newyorkerad-whale.png"></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/tie-ad.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-222" title="tie-ad" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/tie-ad.png" alt="" width="350" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>You know what else was also interesting? The Absolut ads on the back cover. I&#8217;d congratulate them on snagging a customer before she knew what vodka was, but I think the last time I bought vodka was five years ago, and it was Grey Goose.</p>
<p><em>Commentary:</em> I keep drawing with the tablet because it&#8217;s less messy, erasing is easier, and I can skip scanning altogether. The line quality is much worse, though, so I&#8217;m trading quality for convenience. There&#8217;s surely a way to draw with a tablet without it looking crappy, so I&#8217;ve got to figure that out. Also, I really enjoy doing fake ads.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I find Christina Aguilera interesting. I know &#8220;interesting&#8221; is a backhanded compliment, meaning something like &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of anything I actually like about you&#8221; or &#8220;I view your work with the same fascination that I view my ingrown toenails and zombie ant fungus.&#8221; Actually, I wouldn&#8217;t say Christina Aguilera is much like zombie ant fungus: zombie ant fungus figured out what worked long ago, and stuck with it. Aguilera is still evolving, with entertaining misfires along the way.</p>
<p>What keeps Aguilera so interesting is her desperation to say&#8230; something. She doesn&#8217;t have very much to say that isn&#8217;t LOOK AT ME. Look at me, I&#8217;m a great singer. Look at me, I&#8217;m edgy and provocative. Look at me, I&#8217;m sophisticated. Look at me, I&#8217;m still edgy and provocative, just like that Gaga lady, except <em>I</em> am a great singer! Oh, won&#8217;t someone <em>look</em> at me??</p>
<p>So I was interested to learn of her new LOOK AT ME feature film. It seems like she&#8217;s a few years late to hop on that particular vehicle; Britney did it eight years ago. Judging from the trailer, <em>Burlesque </em>seems pretty paint-by-numbers: small-town girl with a big voice and big dreams tries to make it in the big city, and of course she does because she&#8217;s special.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m wrong and it&#8217;s really good. Maybe it subverts the clich√©, or maybe it&#8217;s a beautifully-written/acted/directed love letter to the clich√©. Maybe it&#8217;s got amazing cinematography or choreography or costume design. I admit that I&#8217;m not willing to sit through ninety minutes of Christina Aguilera impressing herself with vocal runs to find out.</p>
<p>Instead, I drew how I imagine the movie will go. Enjoy!</p>
